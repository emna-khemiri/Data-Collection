During this period, I had the opportunity to work on an intriguing project that connects the fields of medicine and technology. The main goal of my internship was to develop a full-stack website for exploring deep learning algorithms to predict heart issues, which made it an incredibly rewarding experience.\n\nThroughout the internship, I delved into various technologies, including ReactJS, SpringBoot, and Flask, and I also explored the world of DevOps. However, what truly made this experience special was collaborating with a diverse team of researchers and engineers. Witnessing how technology can directly impact the field of medicine was truly fascinating.\n\nI'd like to extend my gratitude to Ahmad Fall for his invaluable support and guidance during this journey.\n\nI'm thankful to the entire UMMISCO team for their assistance. This internship not only deepened my passion for technology but also opened doors to exciting job opportunities. I'm enthusiastic about further exploring this field and working on innovative projects. \n\nThis internship was more than just a job; it was a journey of learning and personal growth.\n#Internship #UMMISCO #MedicalResearch #Tech #Learning #Passion #Innovation #FullStack #ReactJS #SpringBoot #DevOps #DeepLearning",

            "text": "Today especially with the High school graduation results in Tunisia (Le fameux Bac) and people asking me about careers after high school (Est-ce que choisir l'informatique est une d√©cision judicieuse si je n'aime pas vraiment √ßa / J'ai peur de faire le mauvais choix... ) , I want to address a topic that many of us, especially young professionals, grapple with: the pressure to have our lives figured out at a young age. \n\nSociety bombards us with expectations, suggesting that we should have a clear career path, a solid plan, and all the answers by the time we reach our twenties. But here's the truth: life is a beautiful, messy, and unpredictable journey, and it's okay not to have it all figured out. Even if it seems that everybody got everything figured out .\n\nI speak from personal experience who has felt the weight of these expectations. However, I have come to realize that embracing the journey and allowing ourselves the space to explore, grow, and make mistakes is an invaluable part of our personal and professional development. It‚Äôs not a problem if you do not like the job you‚Äôve been dying to have you still have plenty of time to change and restart again.\n\nWe need to shift the narrative and acknowledge that finding our purpose and carving our path is a process that unfolds over time. It's about embracing the uncertainties, taking risks, and being open to new opportunities that may lead us in unexpected and fulfilling directions. Instead of succumbing to the pressure, let's cultivate resilience and adaptability. let's remember that success is subjective and unique to each individual. It's not defined by a predetermined timeline or societal expectations. It's about finding fulfillment and happiness in the journey, rather than reaching a specific destination.\n\nSo, to all the young professionals out there feeling the weight of the world's expectations, I encourage you to embrace the uncertainty, trust the process, and be kind to yourself. You are not alone in this journey, and it's okay not to have all the answers right now. Allow yourself the freedom to explore, experiment, and discover your true passions. There is no Timeline for that .\n\nTogether, let's redefine success and support one another as we navigate the beautiful chaos of life. Let's celebrate the small victories, embrace the detours, and remind ourselves that the journey is just as important as the destination if not BETTER.\n#EmbraceTheJourney #ThrivingYoungProfessionals #SuccessIsAJourney #ai #success #job #career #opportunities ",

It is truly exciting to be part of a project that has the potential to revolutionize the way #pilots interact with the #cockpit plus I get to hangout with #planes and try #simulators so WIN WIN.\n\nAs someone who has always been fascinated by #airplanes and #aviation, and happily waited as kid for planes to go above my head I couldn't think of a more perfect compromise between #work and #passion I enjoy spending my days surrounded by #planes, learning about the latest #technology from my amazing team and supervisor, and being part of a team that is shaping the future of #aviation and is also fun to be around.\n\nHopefully, I'll be able to share my insights and experiences with you all along the way on the unique challenges and rewards that come with integrating #AI into aircraft #design and #operations.

By taking a step back and finding the humor in my self-doubts, I was able to realize that it's all just a part of the process.\nAnd then I started to approach everything I did as a passion. Whether it was my #work, my #hobbies, or my relationships, I found something to be passionate about and dove in headfirst. This included my approach to school as well, although it might be controversial to say that I didn't take it as seriously as some people did.\n\nWhen I started pursuing what I wanted to do in life. I thought to myself as a 16 years old , \"Who am I to pursue this? I don't have the qualifications or experience that other people in the field have.\" But then I realized that what I lacked in qualifications, I made up for in #passion and if it didn‚Äôt work at least I made it fun.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that #ImposterSyndrome magically disappeared overnight.

It is truly exciting to be part of a project that has the potential to revolutionize the way #pilots interact with the #cockpit plus I get to hangout with #planes and try #simulators so WIN WIN.\n\nAs someone who has always been fascinated by #airplanes and #aviation, and happily waited as kid for planes to go above my head I couldn't think of a more perfect compromise between #work and #passion I enjoy spending my days surrounded by #planes, learning about the latest #technology from my amazing team and supervisor, and being part of a team that is shaping the future of #aviation and is also fun to be around.\n\nHopefully, I'll be able to share my insights and experiences with you all along the way on the unique challenges and rewards that come with integrating #AI into aircraft #design and #operations.
