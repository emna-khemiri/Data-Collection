Learn some xpath, css selectors and basic html too!\n2) google it - this might seem obvious, but learn to search properly and you might actually find very useful things\n3) there's a github repo with a LOT of datasets, link https://lnkd.in/eqiZWZNE\n4) a website called components has good datasets too:\nhttps://lnkd.in/e6ACGPAs\n5) kdnuggets:\nhttps://lnkd.in/eibhGzuC\n6) open data inception:\nhttps://lnkd.in/eCP_P2xK\n7) opendatasoft:\nhttps://lnkd.in/eMRbxM3U\n8) databar\nhttps://databar.ai/\n9) gov data websites:\nhttps://us.gov/\nhttps://data.gov.in/\n10) google's search engine for datasets https://lnkd.in/er_NUXW6 \n11) reddit has some datasets too!\nhttps://lnkd.in/eCZci-Nh - check the\n\"data\" section of the sidebar\n12)OSF HOME:\nhttps://osf.io/\n13) an article on links to good datasets ( health DataSets)\nhttps://lnkd.in/etwU3THG\n14) research papers!\nwhen i wanted some aero data I typed on google scholar « Aero data ». I then went onto relevant papers, and typed things like \"data collection\",\"data source\", \"repository\" etc. this gave me an idea on how other people were collecting data, and i was so happy to find alternate sources/ways of collecting data.\n15) UCI's machine learning repository:\nhttps://lnkd.in/eDgWAyBW\n16) Similar to the above link, many research labs keep working on datasets. Stanford, for example has : \nhttps://lnkd.in/es57yC5Y\n17) make your own dataset using faker's library\nhttps://lnkd.in/e9bs26c7\n18) Hugging face:\nThis has great datasets to work with as well.\nhttps://lnkd.in/e7Ry_jJS\n19) adding json to any subreddit will display the data on it. This is something I just found about, and it absolutely blew me away.\n20) Academic Torrents:\nhttps://lnkd.in/e7FDedk9\n21) YouTube-8M Segments Dataset\nhttps://lnkd.in/ec3KW2b8\n22) Open Street Map!\nhttps://lnkd.in/eeqe8pug\nI hope this served you well!\n#datasets #data #datascience #machinelearning #artificialintelligence #kaggle #github",

I want to talk about something I really care about: Artificial Intelligence.\nAs I'm looking for jobs, I've noticed more and more people getting into AI (300+ candidates for every job offer ) just because it's popular or for the money (data scientist being the sexiest job of the 21st century) , without really loving the subject. So, here's my simple advice:\nIf you don't truly love AI, if you don't feel really excited about it about new technologies and new advancements, maybe think about your choice. If you're only after money ( that doesn't mean work for free don't get me wrong!), you might end up unhappy because the field is getting really crowded. Ask yourself, would you still do it for fun if you didn't get paid? Your answer matters.\n\nRemember why you started this journey and find joy in it\n\n\n\n#ArtificialIntelligence #TechnologyForGood #ContinuousLearning",

But here's the truth: life is a beautiful, messy, and unpredictable journey, and it's okay not to have it all figured out. Even if it seems that everybody got everything figured out .\n\nI speak from personal experience who has felt the weight of these expectations. However, I have come to realize that embracing the journey and allowing ourselves the space to explore, grow, and make mistakes is an invaluable part of our personal and professional development. It’s not a problem if you do not like the job you’ve been dying to have you still have plenty of time to change and restart again.\n\nWe need to shift the narrative and acknowledge that finding our purpose and carving our path is a process that unfolds over time. It's about embracing the uncertainties, taking risks, and being open to new opportunities that may lead us in unexpected and fulfilling directions. Instead of succumbing to the pressure, let's cultivate resilience and adaptability. let's remember that success is subjective and unique to each individual. It's not defined by a predetermined timeline or societal expectations. It's about finding fulfillment and happiness in the journey, rather than reaching a specific destination.\n\nSo, to all the young professionals out there feeling the weight of the world's expectations, I encourage you to embrace the uncertainty, trust the process, and be kind to yourself. You are not alone in this journey, and it's okay not to have all the answers right now. Allow yourself the freedom to explore, experiment, and discover your true passions. There is no Timeline for that .\n\nTogether, let's redefine success and support one another as we navigate the beautiful chaos of life. Let's celebrate the small victories, embrace the detours, and remind ourselves that the journey is just as important as the destination if not BETTER.\n#EmbraceTheJourney #ThrivingYoungProfessionals #SuccessIsAJourney #ai #success #job #career #opportunities ",

I couldn't resist the urge to revisit the game and test the latest version. Having not touched it since my childhood, I was eager to see how far it had come, particularly in terms of AI integration. And let me tell you, I was absolutely blown away.\n\nOne aspect that truly astonished me was the seamless integration of the Air Traffic Control (ATC) system. The AI-controlled ATC controllers demonstrated remarkable precision and accuracy, effortlessly adapting to changing weather conditions, intricate flight plans, complex airspaces, and even aircraft condition. It was truly impressive to witness the AI's ability to provide realistic and responsive guidance to players. Achieving such accuracy is undoubtedly challenging, and I am keen to learn more about the underlying architecture behind the ATC system. I wonder if it leverages the power of data, incorporates an exceptional optimization algorithm, or employs a hybrid approach.\n\nFurthermore, I must acknowledge the significant role of Azure's integration in enhancing the overall experience. The use of AI Speech Generation technology for the flight controller voices resulted in human-like voices that made me question whether voice actors were involved at all.\n\nI can't contain my excitement for the release of Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024. The opportunity to explore the vast skies, with the game's emphasis on different aviation professions and its ability to construct a detailed and realistic representation of our planet by processing an impressive 2.5 petabytes of Bing Maps satellite photo data through Azure machine learning, is something I eagerly anticipate.\n\n#MicrosoftFlightSimulator2024 #AIIntegration #AviationProfessions #ATCIntegration #ImmersiveGaming #aviation #machinelearning #ai #azure",

            "text": "What is Adversarial Validation In Machine Learning? \n\nThis year as part of a class we had to compete at the Defi-IA , a prominent French competition, presented an exciting challenge that went beyond the creation of AI models. Participants had the  opportunity to work with an API designed for this challenge for data retrieval, considering various strategies and addressing potential biases. The Defi-IA experience emphasized the significance of addressing biases and distributional differences when working with external data sources .It was an exhilarating journey that ultimately led us to the utilization of adversarial validation. \n\nSo, what exactly is adversarial validation? Inspired by FastML's concept, it revolves around assessing the similarity between training and test data in terms of feature distribution. By validating the degree of similarity, we can uncover potential discrepancies and avoid overfitting, ultimately improving our model's performance. It's a simple yet powerful approach to understand the variables that influence our dataset. \n\nWhile initially faced with challenges in aligning the API data with the test dataset and securing higher leaderboard positions, adversarial validation emerged as a turning point in our journey. It bridged the gap between our model's performance and the test dataset, offering valuable insights and enabling us to refine our approaches. However, we acknowledge that the effectiveness of adversarial validation in competition settings may differ when applied to real-life datasets, necessitating careful consideration.  \n\nIt's rather essential to recognize the limitations of adversarial validation, particularly its potential to overfit to the adversarial data and compromise generalization capabilities. Striking the right balance between addressing biases and maintaining model performance on real-world data remains crucial for data scientists. \n\nLet's engage in meaningful discussions about the merits and limitations of adversarial validation if you did use it before, both in competition settings and real-life datasets, to uncover new strategies and push the boundaries of what's possible. \n\n#AdversarialValidation #KaggleCompetitions #DataScience #MachineLearning #BiasInData #RealLifeDatasets #DefiIA #Insights #Collaboration\n",

            "text": "Defending Machine Learning Models Against Adversarial Attacks: Safeguarding in the Cyber Age \n\nIn today's technology-driven world, machine learning models have become integral to various domains. However, these models are not immune to manipulation. Adversarial attacks have emerged as a significant concern, exploiting vulnerabilities in machine learning systems. Let's explore the realm of adversarial attacks and defenses, shedding light on these concepts and strategies to safeguard our models. 🛡️\n\nAdversarial attacks involve intentional manipulation of input data to deceive machine learning models. Crafted with precision, adversarial examples mislead models into making incorrect predictions. These examples closely resemble legitimate data but contain carefully engineered perturbations. Adversarial attacks pose a threat to the security and integrity of machine learning systems, necessitating the need for robust defenses.\nTo counter this rising threat, researchers have been actively developing defense strategies. Here are some prominent approaches:\n\n1️⃣ Adversarial Training: Augmenting the training dataset with adversarial examples, models are exposed to manipulated data during training. This process enables them to recognize and counter such attacks, enhancing their robustness and generalization to unseen adversarial examples.\n2️⃣ Defensive Distillation: Instead of hard labels, models are trained using soft labels—probabilities assigned to different classes. This nuanced understanding of data makes models more resilient to adversarial perturbations, making it difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.\n3️⃣ Input Preprocessing: Employing various preprocessing techniques, such as filtering out high-frequency noise or utilizing denoising algorithms, helps detect and remove adversarial perturbations. These methods aid in cleaning input data and reducing the impact of manipulative attacks.\n\nAs machine learning models continue to play a significant role in our lives, addressing their vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks is crucial. Such attacks undermine trust, reliability, and security. By implementing defense mechanisms we can enhance the resilience of machine learning models against adversaries.\nThe field of adversarial attacks and defenses is continuously evolving, and researchers are actively exploring new techniques. Protecting machine learning models from adversarial attacks remains an ongoing challenge in the cybersecurity domain. Let's stay vigilant, advance research, and implement robust defense mechanisms to pave the way for safer and more secure machine learning systems in the cyber age. 🌐\n#MachineLearning #Cybersecurity #AdversarialAttacks #DefenseStrategies #DataSecurity",

            "text": "Beyond the Binary: Being Both a Musician and an Engineer \n\nWhen I stepped into the engineering world, people assumed that music was just a hobby for me—a mere escape from the logical confines of science .Similarly, when I immersed myself in the music world from a professional point of view, pursuing my passion for Music, no one believed that I was also a passionate AI practitioner. The surprise on their faces when they discovered my deep love for engineering and artificial intelligence was palpable. I found myself constantly categorized, with questions like, \"Are you more of a musician or an engineer?\"\n\nBut life doesn't have to be a choice between one path or the other. It doesn't mean that all I will ever do is build AI models. Someday, I may find myself at the very center of a music career. For years until now all I do is try to juggle both worlds.\n\nPeople tend to give you dedicated roles, labeling science as your \"work\" and music as your \"passion.\" But to me, this differentiation between science and arts has always seemed absurd. I found rigor and discipline in the arts, while my scientific pursuits sparked imagination and creativity. Science and art were interwoven, complementary forces in my life The two realms coexist and thrive within me.\n\nIf you find  yourself straddling multiple paths, whether it's sketching alongside your engineering career or pursuing sports while nurturing another passion, I encourage you to embrace both. You are not simply an engineer or a painter, a musician or a doctor. You are BOTH You are a multi-faceted individual with diverse talents and passions. Each aspect of your identity is valid and impressive. Do not let the pressure of societal expectations force you to choose one over the other.\n\nThere is a prevailing notion that academia discourages pursuing side interests, arguing that one should focus solely on studying to secure a \"real\" job. But in my eyes, that perspective is nothing more than misguided. I firmly believe that you should do both—pursue your passions alongside your academic pursuits. If it weren't for music, I wouldn't be as proficient in my engineering career and studies. And if it weren't for my engineering endeavors, my musical abilities would not have reached their fullest potential.\n\nSo, let go of the notion that you have to fit into a single mold. Embrace the fusion of your passions. Break the barriers between science and art. Explore the uncharted territories where music and AI converge. Allow your diverse interests to shape and amplify your journey. By integrating your passions, you will discover a profound sense of fulfillment and unleash your true potential. \nEmbrace your multifaceted identity, and don't let anyone diminish the significance of either realm. You are both —an embodiment of the powerful synergy between science and art.\n\n#MusicAndAI #PassionAndInnovation #ScienceAndArt #EmbraceYourPassions #artificialintelligence #work #engineering #art #career",

Traditional numerical methods can be computationally expensive and may not be suitable for problems with limited data or poorly understood physics. However, Physical Informed #NeuralNetworks (#PINNs) provide a novel approach to differential equation solving that offers significant advantages over traditional methods. It might not always work but it’s also worth the try . \n#PINNs use deep neural networks to approximate the solution of differential equations. The neural network architecture is designed to incorporate physical knowledge and constraints, enabling it to generalize well to new data and handle noisy or incomplete information.#PINNs can also reduce computational costs by learning to solve the differential equations directly, without requiring a discretization of the domain. \nTo improve the performance of #PINNs, here are some hints and tricks to keep in mind:\n1-Choose the right #network architecture: The choice of network architecture can have a significant impact on the performance of PINNs. For example, residual networks can help avoid vanishing gradients, while attention-based networks can help focus on important regions of the input.\n2-Incorporate #physics-informed loss functions: PINNs can benefit from incorporating physical knowledge into the loss function. This can be achieved by adding penalty terms that enforce conservation laws or other constraints that are known to hold in the problem domain.\n3-Use adaptive learning rates: PINNs can be sensitive to the choice of learning rate. Using adaptive learning rate algorithms such as Adam or Adagrad can help improve convergence and avoid overfitting.\nRegularize the network: PINNs can be prone to overfitting, especially when working with limited data. Regularization techniques such as dropout or weight decay can help improve generalization and prevent overfitting.\n\nIf you are interested in PINN’s and want to delve in the subject send me a message and I can send you some ressources and Jupiter notebooks to begin with ! #machinelearning #data #physics #modeling ",

Yep, that's Imposter Syndrome, and let me tell you, it's a doozy. \n\nBut here's the thing, acknowledging the fact that everyone, even the ones you admire, has self-doubts can help you conquer it. And one way to do that is by laughing at yourself.\nI used to think I was an imposter too, until I learned to laugh it up whenever I felt that way. By taking a step back and finding the humor in my self-doubts, I was able to realize that it's all just a part of the process.\nAnd then I started to approach everything I did as a passion. Whether it was my #work, my #hobbies, or my relationships, I found something to be passionate about and dove in headfirst. This included my approach to school as well, although it might be controversial to say that I didn't take it as seriously as some people did.\n\nWhen I started pursuing what I wanted to do in life. I thought to myself as a 16 years old , \"Who am I to pursue this? I don't have the qualifications or experience that other people in the field have.\" But then I realized that what I lacked in qualifications, I made up for in #passion and if it didn’t work at least I made it fun.\n\nNow, I'm not saying that #ImposterSyndrome magically disappeared overnight. But I've learned to embrace it, to laugh at its ridiculousness, and to use it as fuel to propel me forward.\n\nBy shifting my vision and approaching everything as a passion, I was able to get out of the imposter mood that every student goes through, especially in university. I gave up on competition and started focusing on my personal growth, and the results were amazing. I found myself succeeding more and more, and enjoying (most of the time) the journey.\n\nSo, let's all take a deep breath and acknowledge the fact that we are all works in progress. Imposter Syndrome is something that we all go through, but by laughing at ourselves and approaching everything with passion, we can conquer it.\nHave you ever felt Imposter Syndrome ? Share your experience and let's demistify it \n#ImposterSyndrome #ConquerTheWorld #LaughAtYourself #ApproachWithPassion",

            "text": "\"Flying High with Preference Learning: The Art of Predicting Choices\"\n\nHave you ever considered the complexity of decision-making and its impact on our lives, from choosing what to eat for lunch (It's like a never-ending game of \"What's for lunch?\" .Shoutout to all moms when they used to make that choice for us) to the significant choices affecting our careers, relationships, and health? Decision-making is a critical aspect of our daily lives and can be influenced by personal preferences, past experiences, societal norms, and emotions. Making informed decisions based on objective criteria rather than biases is essential to our well-being, especially in sensitive fields. This is where preference learning comes into play.\n\nPreference learning is a process that predicts the choices individuals make based on their preferences. I have been exploring this approach in the aviation and space industry, and it has the potential to revolutionize decision-making. By analyzing the preferences of pilots, astronauts, and passengers, we can gain insights into their decision-making and make more informed choices.\nHowever, preference learning is not without its controversies. First question Raised is how accurately could it be predicting human preferences on data that may be inherently biased. Additionally, it may lead to a lack of transparency and accountability, making it challenging to understand how decisions are being made especially in very stressful situations and emergencies in cockpits for example.\n\nPreference learning is a fascinating and technical approach, I’ve been exploring it a bit lately using preference statements integrated in decision trees such as Constraint-based decision tree In this approach, the preference statements are used as constraints to restrict the decision tree from making certain decisions that are not preferred. For example, if the preference statement is that a decision should not exceed a certain cost or time limit, then the decision tree algorithm can be modified to exclude decision paths that violate this constraint or Penalty-based decision tree In this approach, the preference statements are used as penalties to discourage the decision tree from making certain decisions that are not preferred. For example, if the preference statement is that a decision should minimize a certain cost or maximize a certain benefit, then the decision tree algorithm can be modified to penalize decision paths that do not satisfy this preference.\n\nLet's dive into the #technical and especially the #ethical aspects of #PreferenceLearning and discuss its potential as a #gamechanger for decision-making in fields like aviation and space industry. But also, let's not forget the concerns about #bias and lack of #transparency and #accountability. Join the conversation! #DecisionMaking #DataScience #AI #MachineLearning #preferencelearning",

            "text": "Is Data-Driven AI Overrated? Are We Forgetting Something? \n\nAfter reflecting on my experience as an #AI practitioner over the past few months, I have gained a deeper understanding of the significant role that model-driven AI plays in building successful AI #systems. This realization is particularly important in industries such as #aerospace, where #safety is of utmost importance, and model #explainability is a critical aspect of the #work. \n\nWhile the industry has made great strides in #data-driven AI due to advancements in neural net algorithms, data storage, and fast processors, it's essential not to overlook the benefits of #model-driven AI. Symbolic AI attempts to capture knowledge and derive decisions through explicit representation and rules, making it ideal for highly codified domains where knowledge can be captured in a model.\n\nThe question, therefore, is whether there are situations that are a good fit for explicit models and whether we can have systems that are purely model or data-driven or whether we gain more from combining the two. It is essential to appreciate what a structured AI model brings to the table to effectively combine different AI tools. Without a software engineering paradigm specifically focused on AI #software, we risk missing out on useful tooling and reinventing the wheel repeatedly.\n\nSo how can we effectively combine different AI tools to achieve the best results? The answer lies in the combination of data-driven and model-driven AI. By appreciating what a structured AI model brings to the table, we can integrate it with the latest data-driven AI techniques and tools to create more effective and impactful AI solutions.\n\nBy integrating the best of both worlds, we can leverage the power of data-driven AI techniques to extract value from vast amounts of data and combine it with model-driven AI to capture explicit knowledge and derive decisions through explicit representation and rules.\n\nOne of the benefits of a hybrid model in AI is improved accuracy and explainability. While data-driven AI techniques can provide accurate predictions and insights, they often lack #transparency . Model-driven AI, on the other hand, provides a transparent and interpretable framework for #decision  making, allowing us to understand how decisions are made and why certain actions were taken. By combining the two approaches, we can achieve both #accuracy and #transparency, making it easier to understand and interpret the #results .\nAlso by incorporating model-driven AI, we can reduce the amount of irrelevant information and false positives, resulting in a more efficient and effective system.\n\nTo do so, we need to have a software engineering paradigm that's specifically focused on AI #software. By building a strong foundation for #AI #development and deployment, we can ensure that we're leveraging AI in the best possible way.\n\nTo all the #AI #practitioners out there share your #thoughts and #experiences in the comments below.\n",
