PhD is conducted under the Joint Study Agreement No.W1463335, between IBM Research and Khalifa University. \n\nPhD research focused on the dynamic and distributed management of cloud applications hosted on container platform. My research has developed distributed learning with dynamic ML model selection and demonstrated its implementation through cloud network security dataset. Further, I worked extensively with progressive learning using a deep neural network (DNN). I elaborated on one of the major problem of progressive DNN as its inability to detect network saturation in the shared weight space in order to assess its potential to incorporate additional training data. The detection of such saturation is especially important for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting of prior weights. Another problem I elaborated is that when progressive learning uses a fully connected DNN, the computationally-intensive backpropagation training slows down the dynamic tracking of the changing data.  My research addresses those challenges under a unified framework for cloud application management. I built a cloud DevOps architecture based on Docker and Kubernetes, implemented and tested on several applications using container orchestration. In the case of a DNN, I developed an algorithm to generate a compact network that is more tractable to train. My research further proposes a methodology for measuring DNN saturation based on second-order network information. The unified DevOps framework was further expanded to generate explainable ML models for various workloads.",
