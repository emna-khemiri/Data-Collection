Jack Selby of Thiel Capital is using a new VC fund to invest in Arizona startups,https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/17/jack-selby-of-thiel-capital-is-using-a-new-vc-fund-to-invest-in-arizona-startups/,"Jack Selby, a former PayPal exec and the longtime managing director of Thiel Capital who attracted some attention years back for his low-key largesse, has a new, $110 million venture fund that he intends to invest mostly in his adopted state of Arizona, where Selby has lived since 2002. The debut vehicle of the firm, called AZ-VC, is backed by a number of real-estate outfits in Arizona, along with a major local utility company. Notably, however, Thiel is not an investor and neither are any of Thiel Capital’s many institutional backers. We talked earlier today with Selby — who was calling from the Milken Institute summit in Abu Dhabi and planning to attend the last Formula One race of the season afterward — to learn more about why that is. We also talked with Selby about his relationship with Thiel and whether, like a growing number of people in Thiel’s universe, Selby plans to jump into regional politics at some point, using this fund as a jumping-off point. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. TC: You’ve been running Peter Thiel’s family office for years, which is in California, but you are in Arizona. How did that happen? JS: My father worked for a “MadMen” era advertising firm called J. Walter Thompson, in a job where you either got fired or promoted every three or four years. My dad [experienced] a bit of both, so we had this almost army brat-type upbringing, moving seven times during my childhood. During my senior year, I refused to move [from our then-home] in suburban Detroit and stayed with a friend and his family until graduation, but my dad moved to Phoenix; my younger brother grew up in Phoenix. And going in the summers in between college, I really kind of fell in love with the place. Later, I was part of the group that started PayPal [as a VP nearly straight out of college] and when we sold the business to eBay in 2002, I knew I wanted to get away from the onerous tax regime of California. Arizona was kind of the obvious choice, so I moved in 2002, and I’ve been a happy resident for a lot of years. Do you spend much time in West Hollywood, where Thiel Capital is now based? I pop back and forth between Arizona and California quite often. That’s one of the appeals of Arizona. Contrary to the whole narrative that’s been built up around Austin and certainly Miami, proximity to California matters. If you can get back and forth to California in an hour or so by plane, that’s very convenient, whereas it’s a four-hour flight from Austin. It’s one of the huge advantages I think we have in Arizona. It does seem like a lot of people have headed from California to Scottsdale in particular. Are different cities in Arizona known for different industries? A lot of the big defense contractors like Lockheed Martin have a presence in Arizona. A lot of the chip companies have a presence in Arizona. Phoenix is the fifth [most-populous] city in the United States, which a lot of folks don’t know, so you have pockets of activity throughout greater Phoenix, ranging from Glendale, which is in the far northwest corner, and all points in between. The best analogy I can give you is Los Angeles, but just, say, 50 years earlier. You’ve receiving backing for your fund from Arizona’s real estate industry, and your anchor investor is a utility company that committed to invest $25 million in the fund. Why would a utility company do this? I don’t mean this to compliment myself, but it was a two-year-long courting process to get them across the finish line. With my day job with Peter, and I say this very humbly, but I basically know every LP that allocates venture capital in the world, whether they’re here in Abu Dhabi or Tokyo or New York or wherever it is. They all know who we are, and they would love to curry favor with him by giving money to some new fund that’s connected to Peter’s universe. But I wanted to use the fund as a litmus test to see if the Arizona community wanted to see something like this fund rise up and get off the ground. Honestly, I didn’t know what the result was going to be, but I was very heartened by the fact that people raised their hand and put us in business. Two things. First, I’m still not understanding why a utility company is a natural fit here. Arizona has been very, very real estate oriented, and if you look back across various housing cycles, Arizona has been the poster child for the boom and bust because we don’t have much diversification in terms of industry. The thinking from a utility perspective is [anything that] helps diversify the economy and helps build up the technology sector within Arizona [is a positive] that will help smooth out some of these ups and downs. And you expressly didn’t want or ask for capital from Peter or Thiel Capital’s LPs. Why? My day job with Peter is protecting the nest, so to speak, and the nest is very important. Peter is my golden goose. I’ve been working with him longer than anyone else. He’s a very close friend. He’s a very loyal person. As you might imagine, we get barraged with unsolicited inquiries looking for his backing all day long. So sure, I could have gotten [their collective backing] but I didn’t go to a sovereign wealth fund in Abu Dhabi or go to Peter because they have no connection or ties to Arizona and I want people to be involved. I want people to be advisors. I want them to be deal scouts. I want them to be mentors. And the Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund is not going to do that. Playing devil’s advocate here, what if you strike gold in Arizona? Will that be a problem for Thiel Capital’s investors? If we get to the point where Peter is sniffing around and wanting to look at a deal [in AZ-VC’s portfolio], then that’s mission accomplished. I will gladly figure out that conundrum. Obviously, a growing number of people in Peter’s world are running for public office. Might this fund be a kind of precursor to a possible political campaign at some point? No, I don’t have any interest in politics. I’m only interested in the sense that I want to see our political environment be as middle and down the fairway and normal as it possibly can be. I don’t want to see another Sheriff Joe come about because Sheriff Joe is bad for business. Regarding your relationship with Peter, you’ve worked with him since 1999, but pretty much everyone I’ve known who works for him has worked for him since nearly the outset of their career, sometimes over decades. What is it about him and the culture around him that keeps people around for so long?
 He prizes loyalty and he is himself just an extremely loyal person, and I think he’s been so mischaracterized in the media. Obviously, I’m biased, but it drives me crazy. He’s a very normal guy. He’s very rational. He’s obviously very smart. And I have a huge amount of respect for him. I will never voluntarily leave the orbit of Peter Thiel. It’s a pretty amazing seat to have.","Jack Selby, a former PayPal exec, has a new, $110 million venture fund that he intends to invest mostly in his adopted state of Arizona.

Paytm raises $1.1 billion from anchor investors in India’s blockbuster IPO,https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/03/paytm-raises-1-1-billion-from-anchor-investors-in-indias-blockbuster-ipo/,"Paytm has raised $1.104 billion in India’s largest-ever anchor round as part of its initial public offering, which is also shaping up to be the nation’s largest, as the poster child of the Indian startup ecosystem moves closer to listing in the public markets. Blackrock, GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Birla MF are among the investors who financed the anchor round, Paytm said in a filing with a local exchange. Bidding for shares of Paytm was oversubscribed by 10 times, according to a person familiar with the matter. With Wednesday’s investment, Paytm has now secured nearly half of the $2.45 billion capital it is looking to raise from the IPO. The startup, which offers a range of financial services, is seeking a valuation of over $19 billion in the IPO, it said in a call with reporters last week. Backed by Alibaba, Berkshire Hathaway and SoftBank, Paytm was valued at $16 billion in its previous funding round in the second half of 2019. The investments of $140 million by Blackrock and $126 million by CPPIB are also the largest by institutional investors in an Indian IPO. Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, Dutch pension investment firm APG, City of New York, Texas Teachers Retirement, NPS Japan, University of Texas, NTUC Pension out of Singapore, University of Cambridge, UBS, Mirae Asset and Standard Life Aberdeen also participated in the anchor round. Paytm, which will open the bid for its shares for three days starting November 8, has kept the share price range between 2,080 to 2,150 Indian rupees ($27.9 to $28.85). The startup is planning to list around November 18, TechCrunch has previously reported. A successful listing would enable Paytm to attain the title of the biggest IPO in India, surpassing a record $2.07 billion initial public offering by government-owned coal mining and refining firm Coal India 11 years ago. Paytm launched in 2009 to help users easily make digital payments from their phones and top up credit. It has since expanded to a wide range of services such as payment gateway, e-commerce marketplace, movie and travel ticket booking, as well as insurance and digital gold. The startup, led by Vijay Shekhar Sharma, describes itself as having “created a payments-led super app, through which we offer our consumers innovative and intuitive digital products and services.” The startup says it has amassed more than 330 million users across its services, more than a third of whom transact annually. In a filing last week, Paytm disclosed that it clocked $118 million in revenue from its operations in the quarter that ended in June this year, up 62% from the prior quarter. In Q2, the startup’s losses surged to $50.9 million, Paytm said, citing additional marketing and promotional campaigns in the run up to the IPO. Paytm’s IPO comes at a time when the pandemic has fuelled India’s digital economy and local stock exchanges are showing growing appetite for consumer tech stocks. Indian food delivery giant Zomato made a stellar debut earlier this year. Shares of Nykaa, a fashion e-commerce startup, and Indian insurance aggregator PolicyBazaar, have also seen strong interest by institutional investors in recent days as both of them plan to list later this month. In the filing last week, Paytm said that it plans to deploy more than $250 million of the total capital it is seeking to raise in the IPO to enter new initiatives and explore acquisition opportunities. The startup’s offerings compete with a range of services, including Google Pay, WhatsApp Pay, PhonePe, MakeMyTrip and BookMyShow.","Blackrock, GIC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Birla MF are among the investors who financed the anchor round.

The administration’s $7.5 billion EV charging initiative is supposed to help solve that problem. And now, we finally have clarity around what it will take for companies to access those funds. The Biden administration laid out the final standards for its plan to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers along highways, including a requirement that all EV chargers funded through the Inflation Reduction Act must be built in the United States. Specifically, the final assembly and all manufacturing processes for any iron or steel charger enclosures or housing must occur in the United States. And by July 2024, at least 55% of the cost of all components will need to be manufactured domestically, as well. All chargers are also required to use a standardized payment system that is smartphone-friendly and all connectors must use the “combined charging system” (CCS), which dominates in the U.S. Will this be enough to solve the U.S. EV infrastructure problem? Or does the plan miss some critical points? Let me know what you think and I’ll share it in the next newsletter. OK, let’s dive into the rest of the news of the week.

Brexit has cost Ride & Glide, a micromobility retailer in the U.K., $200,000 per year. Cowboy says it will be profitable by this summer. The company hit $45 million in revenue last year. E-bike incentives lead to more bikers, which makes biking safer, which creates more bikers, which makes biking safer … Electra Bicycle Co. has launched the Loft Go! 7D EQ e-bike. The city cruiser comes in either step-through or step-over frame and costs $2,000. Probably the coolest thing about the bike is it doesn’t even look like an e-bike. The 250 kWh battery is completely integrated and has a 40-mile range. Geely’s Panda Mini, a very cute, affordable mini EV, might be sold in Europe soon. MIT Media Lab is working on a self-driving tricycle that can be summoned on demand. A cool project, but the similar efforts of Tortoise and its three-wheeled ghost scooter have taught us that this will be a hard sell. There’s a petition circulating in New Zealand that aims to convince the government to offer a rebate for e-bikes. Is it a good idea? Obviously, says the woman huffing and puffing up Auckland’s many hills on a pushbike. Will it happen? Maybe if the current Labour-led government moves quickly before the October elections. But when do politicians ever move quickly? Porsche is renaming the Croatian e-bike company it bought in 2021 from Greyp to Porsche eBike Performance. Maybe new bikes will follow. — Rebecca Bellan  Zeekr sure has managed to make some big moves in its short life. The two-year-old luxury EV brand under China’s largest private carmaker Geely raised $750 million in its Series A funding round. And … wait for it … the company’s post-money valuation is now $13 billion. Wow. And lest you forget, the news comes just two months after Zeekr said it had confidentially filed for an initial public offering in the U.S. We’re not sure what this fresh injection of cash means for its IPO. We’ve reached out to Zeekr and will provide an update. Other deals that got my attention … Cazoo Group, U.K.-based online car retailer, agreed to sell Cluno, its German subscription business, to ViveLaCar GmbH and The Platform Group GmbH & Co. The financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed, the total portfolio includes several thousand cars in the German market, according to the company. ChargerHelp!, a Los Angeles startup that launched an on-demand repair app for EV charging, raised $17.5 million in Series A funding led by Blue Bear Capital. Aligned Climate Capital, Exelon Corporation and previous investors Energy Impact Partners and non sibi ventures also participated. ChargerHelp raised $2.75 million in 2021. Side note: ChargerHelp! was also highlighted by the Biden administration in its EV charging plan announcement that I wrote about earlier. ChargerHelp and SAE International’s Sustainable Mobility Solutions formed a partnership to assist in training the next generation of essential workers who are certified as electric vehicle service equipment maintenance technicians (EVSE). Within the next two years, the EVSE Field Technician Program will help more than 3,000 trainees from low-income, disadvantaged, typically underrepresented communities, and those transitioning from other industries, to reach these jobs. Cylib, the German battery recycling startup, raised €11.6 million ($12.6 million) to build a factory. World Fund led the round, with existing investors Vsquared Ventures and Speedinvest also participating. 10x Founders also joined. Dance, the micro-EV subscription startup created by former SoundCloud and Jimdo founders, raised an additional €12 million ($12.8M) in an equity and debt round led by existing investors HV Capital, Eurazeo and BlueYard. The subscription launched in Berlin and has since expanded to Paris, Hamburg, Munich and Vienna.  Dronamics, an autonomous cargo drone startup based in London, raised $40 million in a pre-seed Series A round that includes investors from Founders Factory, Speedinvest, Eleven Capital and the Strategic Development Fund, the investment arm of the Tawazun Council, Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Hesai, the Chinese lidar company, raised $190 million from its public offering on Nasdaq. TechCrunch’s Rita Liao shares the company’s long and winding road to IPO. Honeycomb Battery Co., an advanced battery technology subsidiary of Global Graphene Group, plans to go public via a merger agreement with special purpose acquisition company Nubia Brand International Corp. The combined entity plans to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Ouster and Velodyne officially merged. TechCrunch interviewed CEO Angus Pacala, who says the next phase of growth isn’t self-driving cars or even advanced driver assistance systems; it’s smart infrastructure. OpenEyes, an insurtech startup focused on commercial automotive fleets, made its public debut and announced it raised $18 million in a Series A funding round. Software investor Insight Partners and Pitango First led the round, with participation by MoreVC. To date, OpenEyes has raised $23 million. Simple Energy raised $20 million to ramp up production of its electric moped in India. Spiffy, an on-demand car care, technology and services company, raised $30 million in a Series C round led by Edison Partners, with participation from existing investors Tribeca Venture Partners, Bull City Venture Partners, IDEA Fund Partners, Trog Hawley Capital, Attinger and Private Access Network. Strategic investors Shell Ventures, Goodyear Ventures, and Mann+Hummel also participated. Via, the on-demand shuttle service and transit tech company, raised another $110 million, bringing the company’s total funding to around $1 billion. The fresh capital pushes Via’s valuation up to $3.5 billion at the same price per share as the company’s previous financing in November of 2021. VivaCity, a traffic sensor and data company, raised $8.5 million in a funding round led by sustainable infrastructure VC investor EnBW New Ventures (ENV), sustainability-led alternative assets and SME investment manager Foresight Group and Gresham House Ventures, the growth equity arm of specialist alternative asset manager Gresham House.  The California Department of Motor Vehicles said companies with permits to test autonomous vehicles in the state reported their technologies drove more than 5.7 million miles during the latest reporting period (December 1, 2021-November 30, 2022). The data was shared as part of the required disengagement reports submitted to the DMV. Other fun facts: 5.1 million of those miles were with a safety driver and 622,257 miles were driverless testing. The total is an increase of more than 1 million miles from the previous reporting period. Zoox has received a permit from the California Department of Motor Vehicles that allows its custom-built robotaxis to operate on public roads. The Zoox robotaxi made its inaugural launch on public roads last weekend. For now, the robotaxi will only carry Zoox employees on a roughly two-mile loop between the company’s two main offices in Foster City, California. (There are more permits to garner before Zoox can launch a commercial operation.) The scope of Zoox’s launch on public roads is limited; however, it does mark another milestone for a company that launched quietly eight years ago with an ambitious goal to build and operate a commercial robotaxi service with its own purpose-built vehicle. Cadillac plans to reveal three more EVs this year that should enter production in 2024. Chris-Craft, yes, the boat company, unveiled its first all-electric concept boat, the Launch 25 GTe, at the 2023 Miami International Boat Show. The European Parliament formally approved a law to ban the sale of new gas and diesel cars in the European Union starting in 2035. Ford plans to invest $3.5 billion to build a factory in Michigan that will make cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries for its growing portfolio of electric vehicles. Ford will work with Chinese company Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., known as CATL. Under the arrangement, Ford’s wholly owned subsidiary would manufacture the battery cells using LFP battery cell knowledge and services provided by CATL. The arrangement has caught the attention of the Chinese government and U.S. Sen. Mark Rubio, who wants the Biden administration to review the deal. One of Ford’s nagging problems has been recalls and other inefficiencies that are cutting into its bottom line. Now, a new issue has popped up that could hurt its EV truck sales. Ford paused production and shipments of the F-150 Lightning due to a potential battery issue. That stoppage, which started at the beginning of last week, has been extended and could last a few weeks. Pacific Gas and Electric Company is partnering with Angel Island Ferry to electrify what will be California’s first zero emission short-route ferry, starting in 2024. Stellantis brand Ram has developed a mid-sized EV pickup truck concept and plans to show it off to dealers next month. Speaking of Ram, the brand revealed a pre-production version of its upcoming full-size electric truck in an ad that aired during the Super Bowl. The Ram 1500 Revolution is packed with screens and, surprisingly buttons and knobs, Matt Burns writes. Subaru issued another recall for its battery electric Solterra crossover due to concerns that hub bolts on the wheels may loosen and cause it to detach. Yup, earnings season is still on. This week, it was Aurora and Gogoro. Next week, Lucid and Joby Aviation report earnings. Aurora Innovation reiterated during its earnings call that it will have enough money to get through mid-2024; the company plans to launch commercial operations by the end of 2024, according to co-founder and CEO Chris Urmson. Aurora reported it ended the year with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Aurora also noted that it recognized the remaining $2 million in collaboration revenue through its agreement with Toyota, for a total of $68 million recognized from the deal in 2022. Aurora’s operating expenses in Q4 were $156 million, $131 million of which was spent on R&D and the rest on SG&A. For the full year, Aurora’s operating expenses were $650 million in total, with $540 million spent on R&D, primarily comprised of personal costs, according to the company. Investors reacted favorably to Aurora’s earnings report, likely because guidance remained unchanged. Gogoro took nearly a 10% hit to its stock price after it reported weak earnings for the fourth quarter. Gogoro made $95.5 million in revenue in Q4, which is down 20.8% YOY. The company blamed foreign exchange rates for this, saying that revenue would have been up an additional $12.4 million had rates remained constant with the average rate of Q4 2021. For the full year, Gogoro pulled revenue of $382.8 million, up 4.6% YOY. The battery swapping company reported a fourth quarter net loss of $12.5 million and a full year net loss of $98.9 million. Gogoro ended 2022 with $236.1 million in cash. The company said it expects revenue for 2023 to land between $400 million and $450 million, an increase of 4.5% to 17.6% compared to 2022. Gogoro said it expects most of that revenue to come from its Taiwan market, despite heavy investment in other markets like India. Joby Aviation has started final assembly on its “company-conforming” eVTOL, which is essentially a prototype that’s a couple steps away from the final version. Joby expects to begin flight testing for the aircraft in the first half of this year. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration said Hyundai and Kia have developed theft deterrent software for more than 8 million of its vehicles that lack an immobilizer system, which has made them a target of thieves across the country. The software will be provided free of charge to vehicle owners. Convoy, the Seattle-based digital freight network that connects truckers with shippers, is shuttering its Atlanta office and laying off workers as part of a restructuring. This is the third time in less than a year that Convoy has laid off workers. The NYT featured Missy Cummings, a professor at George Mason University who specializes in autonomous systems and who spent a year at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Cummings wants to rein in how driver-assistance systems are used. Rivian hired Michael Callahan as its chief legal officer. Callahan is joining Rivian from Stanford University, where he served as executive director of the Arthur and Toni Rembe Rock Center for Corporate Governance and Professor of the Practice of Law. Shoichiro Toyoda, the son of Toyota founder Kiichiro Toyoda and long-serving executive of the automaker, died of heart failure at the age of 97. Shoichiro Toyoda led the company through decades of growth and notably pioneered a new model for quality control in manufacturing and was responsible for Prius and the creation of its luxury brand Lexus. Lyft finally started charging riders wait time fees in December, but drivers are complaining those fees aren’t making it into their wallets. At least, not yet. Uber drivers in New Zealand will be pushing for better pay and working conditions through their first-ever collective agreement with the company. Tesla is one of those companies that never seems to have a quiet period. There is always something going on with the company, or its CEO Elon Musk. And this week was no different. The big three Tesla stories this week involve unions, Biden’s $7.5B EV charging initiative and a recall of its Full Self-Driving software. We covered some of the Biden EV charging business up top. Tesla is a big part of that announcement because the company has agreed to open a portion of its Supercharger and destination charger network to non-Tesla EVs. The company will make at least 7,500 chargers available for all EVs by the end of 2024, according to the White House. At least 3,500 of those will be 250 kW chargers located along highway corridors. All EV drivers will be able to access these stations using the Tesla app or website. Notably, Tesla has also agreed to more than double its supercharger network. TechCrunch’s Tim de Chant weighs in (over at TC+) on what this might mean for the automaker. Meanwhile, trouble is afoot at the company’s Buffalo, New York factory. A group of Tesla employees (known as Tesla Workers United) who work as data labelers on the Autopilot team at the Buffalo plant, announced plans to organize a union. A day later, the group filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board claiming that Tesla fired more than 30 employees who work at the factory in retaliation for union organizing. And, unsurprisingly, Tesla clapped back and called the allegations false. The Tesla Workers United was not amused and held a press conference Saturday to discuss its ongoing union campaign and company’s response to their efforts, including the claims that their Twitter account has been shadowbanned. This could get ugly. Finally, we wrap up the Tesla section with a recall of the company’s “Full Self-Driving” software, an advanced driver-assistance system that federal safety regulators say could allow vehicles to act unsafe around intersections and cause crashes. Tesla said the recall affects 362,758 vehicles equipped with the software (I guess we now know how many folks have FSD). Tesla will release an over-the-air software update, free of charge, to fix the issue. I got lots of DMs and emails about how we shouldn’t call this a recall because it’s not a mechanical problem. An over-the-air software update should not be called a recall!, many of you exclaimed. That’s the accepted terminology used by both companies, so I’m not calling it anything different. And, consider this: Software is just as critical to a vehicle’s safe operations as its mechanical bits. It all matters!","The Biden administration laid out the final standards for its plan to build a national network of electric vehicle chargers. Porsche is renaming the Croatian e-bike company it bought in 2021 from Greyp to Porsche eBike Performance. Ride & Glide, a micromobility retailer in the U.K., says it will be profitable by this summer."
"The Station: Aurora SPACs, a spin on the VanMoof X3 and a chat with Outdoorsy founders",https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/19/the-station-aurora-spacs-a-spin-on-the-vanmoof-x3-and-a-chat-with-outdoorsy-founders/,"The Station is a weekly newsletter dedicated to all things transportation. Sign up here — just click The Station — to receive it every weekend in your inbox. Hello and welcome to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B. Before we jump into the deals, policy moves and micromobbin’ news, I wanted to share the latest founders interview, a new series we launched this spring over at Extra Crunch. Here’s the opener to the interview: Jen Young and Jeff Cavins were sitting in a beige conference room at a downtown Vancouver hotel, wasting away under fluorescent lights, an endless PowerPoint and a pair of sad Styrofoam cups of coffee between them. Young was there on a marketing contract. Cavins was a board member. They shared one of those looks that only couples can understand. It said: There’s got to be something better than this. The “something better than this” ended up becoming Outdoorsy, peer-to-peer RV and camper rental startup. Outdoorsy co-founders detail how they expanded the sharing economy to RVs  The interview with Cavins and Young covers why they started Outdoorsy, how they have evolved and improved their business model and what is coming next. Our series has a tiny twist: We will check in with these founders a year from the date that the interview was published. Enjoy!

You know how those memes keep going around about why it makes total sense the Roaring 20s happened after the Spanish Flu a century ago? They bring up an important point. A very drunken, boisterous summer is already underway in places that are opening up (sorry, Melbourne), and these shenanigans are flying parallel to the rise of electric micromobility vehicles. The end result? People will — and already are — trying to ride these things drunk. Bird announced this week it is launching Safe Start, a new in-app checkpoint designed to discourage people, but ultimately not stop them, from riding under the influence. It kicks off between the hours of 10 p.m. and 4 a.m., when trouble is usually afoot, asking riders attempting to unlock a Bird if they can safely handle the vehicle by correctly entering a keyword into the app. The hope is that within the time it takes a would-be rider to stop swaying, close one eye, squint with the other and punch in those letters, they’ll have realized that they’re in no position to operate machinery and call a cab or hail a ride via an app instead. Lime has had a similar feature for the past couple of years, also activating after 10 p.m. in most markets. It asks riders to type in “Y-E-S” in response to the question, “Do you affirm you are not drunk and fit to ride?” I think it should be a simple, “Are you drunk?” but I have a thing against negative sentence structures. A spokesperson from Lime told me the company is working on a more robust cognitive test as well as something else he can’t share yet, but if I were a betting woman, I’d say it has something to do with sensing whether someone is driving in a straight line or wobbling, an idea the company talked to The Verge about two years ago. Spin also has a similar feature it’s working on that hasn’t yet been launched. However, it’s a bit more involved than what Bird and Lime have launched. Spin will soon feature a quiz that will test reaction times of the rider. The logic follows that people with higher blood alcohol content have slower reaction times. A Spin spokesperson told me the company would work with the city to determine which hours are of most concern and only implement the test during those hours. Slowpokes will have to source another means of transport home, probably with a stop off at the pizza place. Fenix, the shared e-scooter operator out of Abu Dhabi, is launching a 10-minute fresh grocery delivery service on Reem Island, some boujie, high-tech, super dense mixed-use development off the city’s coast. The company figures it’s already paying for the vehicles themselves, the space to charge batteries and the employees to swap batteries and service the scooters, why not put those to use with another business line? Abu Dhabi-based micromobility operator Fenix launches 10-minute grocery delivery service  It might be a logistical stroke of genius, especially if the software managing the fleets, deliveries and rides are integrated well. The company will have an undisclosed number of “dark stores” or private convenience stores (which will also house the batteries for charging) around the island so that those fresh avocados or packs of diapers are never too far from a millionaire’s penthouse. Fenix’s full-time employees will be stationed within the dark stores, accepting orders and putting together the delivery in two minutes before relaying it to a, no doubt, anxious co-worker who will have eight minutes to drop off the goods. I have my doubts about that 10-minute success rate, many of which reside in my concern for the workers, but we’ll see how it goes, I guess. It’s a cool business model. Irish micromobility company Zipp Mobility is making its first expansion off the island, launching its e-scooter operations in Katowice, Poland. It’s a small city in the southern part of the country, but Zipp appears to be putting a stake hold in the region, with plans to launch in the surrounding cities of Sosnowiec and Dabrowa Gornicza by the end of August. Meanwhile, Veo is on its own expansion plans. The company raised $16 million in a Series A, which it’ll use to fund the expansion of its fleet to new cities like Santa Monica, San Diego and New York, while also focusing on developing new form factors for untapped use cases. Micromobility operator Veo raises $16M to fund US expansion  Speaking of New York, Revel has announced a partnership with GridRewards, an app that develops “virtual power plant” software. Essentially, Revel wants to save money while also not messing up NYC’s power grid, so it’s going to try its best to only charge its e-moped fleet when peak demand is low, and less expensive. Revel is also doing a thing with FlixBus, an intercity bus operator. If you book with one, you get discounts with the others. FlixBus passengers travelling between DC and New York City will be eligible for a $5 one-time credit when booking electric mopeds in Revel’s app. Finally, Santa Cruz-based electric bike startup Blix has some new updates to their rides that provide better performance, increased power and range, better brakes, fatter tires and a range of new colors. — Rebecca Bellan  The big AV and deal news of the week is Aurora Innovation’s move to become a publicly traded company through a merger with Reinvent Technology Partners Y, the special purpose acquisition company launched by LinkedIn co-founder and investor Reid Hoffman, Zynga founder Mark Pincus and managing partner Michael Thompson. The announcement confirmed my reporting in June that the companies were close to finalizing a deal. Once the transaction closes, the combined company will be listed on Nasdaq with the ticker symbol AUR and have an implied valuation of $13 billion. Aurora was last valued at $10 billion following its acquisition of Uber’s self-driving unit. SPACs keep rolling as autonomous vehicle startup Aurora targets blank-check debut with $13B valuation  Through the deal, Aurora is capturing $1 billion from private investors, including Baillie Gifford, funds and accounts managed by Counterpoint Global (Morgan Stanley), funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, Inc., PRIMECAP Management Company, Reinvent Capital, XN, Fidelity Management and Research LLC, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, Index Ventures and Sequoia Capital, as well as strategic investments from Uber, PACCAR and Volvo Group. One other note; Aurora also laid out some financial and deployment projections. Aurora plans to begin to generate revenue from trucks without vehicle operators in late 2023 and from cars without vehicle operators in late 2024, according to regulatory filings. Aurora expects to own and operate the trucks Aurora deploys through 2024, and cars that Aurora deploys through 2025 and will transition to a “Driver as a Service” (I guess, DaaS is going to be a thing?) business model. Other deals that got my attention this week … Bookaway, the travel tech startup, raised $46 million in funding from investors Aleph, Corner Ventures and Entrée Capital. Carmera, an HD mapping startup based in New York, has been acquired by Woven Planet Holdings. The announcement comes less than two months since Woven Planet Holdings — an entity created by Toyota to invest in, develop and eventually bring future of transportation technologies like automated driving to market — acquired Lyft’s autonomous vehicle unit known as Level 5 for $550 million. The financial terms were not disclosed. Toyota’s Woven Planet acquires HD mapping startup Carmera  Under terms of the deal, Carmera will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Woven Planet. Carmera will essentially become the U.S. outpost of Woven Planet’s automated mapping platform (AMP) team, which is headquartered in Tokyo. Ro Gupta, co-founder and CEO of Carmera, will report to Mandali Khalesi, who heads up AMP. The startup’s 50-person team will maintain its offices in New York and Seattle and will eventually be integrated into Woven Planet’s 1,000-person-and-growing enterprise, according to Woven Planet CEO James Kuffner. Colis Privé, the French parcel delivery company, has postponed its initial public offering initially planned for early July, citing unfavorable market conditions, Reuters reported. Delhivery gained FedEx Express, a subsidiary of delivery services giant FedEx, as a backer via $100 million investment. The investment comes less than two months after the Indian startup, which is valued at $3 billion, secured $277 million ahead of an initial public offering in the coming quarters. Heart Aerospace, the Swedish electric aviation startup, raised a $35 million Series A funding round. Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Ventures, United Airlines’s venture arm and its regional airline partner Mesa Air Group led the round. Seed investors EQT Ventures and Lowercarbon Capital also participated. The company also received an order from United and Mesa for 200 of its inaugural ES-19 electric aircraft. LG Chem earmarked $5.2 billion over the next four years to build out its battery materials business. The investment comes as automakers and state regulators set targets to transition away from internal combustion engine vehicles, in a shift that will likely be the most transformative to the mobility industry since the invention of the car. Lineage Logistics, a temperature-controlled industrial REIT and logistics provider, has agreed to a strategic alliance with venture capital firm 8VC to invest in and “revolutionize” the transportation and logistics technology sector. The two companies have already co-invested in several  companies over 8VC’s past three funds, including Project44, Trackonomy and Baton. Netradyne, a startup that uses cameras and edge computing to improve commercial driver safety, raised $150 million in Series C funding led by SoftBank Vision Fund 2. Existing investors Point72 Ventures and M12 also participated in the round, bringing Netradyne’s total funding to more than $197 million. Shopmonkey, a startup that offers a cloud-based shop management software designed for the auto repair industry, raised $75 million in a Series C round led by previous investors Bessemer Venture Partners and Index Ventures, as well as additional participation from returning investors Headline and I2BF, and new investor ICONIQ Growth. The funding comes less than a year after announcing a $25 million Series B. Shopmonkey raises $75M Series C to help auto repair shops streamline their business  NoTraffic, an Israeli-based startup that has built an AI-based traffic management platform, raised $17.5 million in a Series A that it will use to support its “rapid scale” of deployments. The company says it will be expanding into dozens of U.S. cities during the second half of this year, and hopes to move into European and Asian markets, as well. The $17.5 million Series A was led by Nielsen Ventures, a fund founded by former Uber and Dropbox executive and Balderton Capital GP Lars Fjeldsoe-Nielsen and VEKTOR Partners. Leading early-stage venture capital investment firm Grove Ventures, insurance leader Menora Mivtachim Group and Meitav Dash, as well as existing investors like lool ventures, Next Gear Ventures and North First Ventures also participated. Lior Handelsman, one of the founders of Solar Edge, an energy manager system, will join the company’s board. Taylor Hatmaker spent quite a bit of time with the VanMoof X3 and published her review this week. As she writes, “some of the best consumer tech from the last decade, I didn’t know I needed an e-bike until I was on one, breezing down the bike lane contemplating my newfound freedom.” Hatmaker provides a deep dive into the tech, appearance, value, rideability and other features in the bike. Check it out. (We hope and plan to be doing more bike reviews in the future; stay tuned!) VanMoof X3 e-bike review: Transportation revelation   Welcome back to Policy Corner! It’s finally here: The European Commission released its ambitious plan to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, and as everyone expected, a proposed ban on the sale of new internal combustion engine cars by 2035 is included. I mentioned in last week’s Policy Corner that I was curious if it would include any mandates for EV chargers or other infrastructure to support transportation electrification, and I was pleased to see that it does. While not quite a mandate, the proposal says it wants EU countries to install public charging stations every 60 kilometers (37.3 miles) on major roads by 2025, and every 150 kilometers (93.2 miles) for hydrogen refueling stations. The ultimate goal is to build 3.5 million new EV charging stations by 2030 and 16.3 million by 2050. Measures like these will hopefully help dissipate range anxiety, a common reason people cite for not choosing an EV today. But hold onto your hats: The proposal still needs to be approved by all 27-member states before it can take effect. And France — where automaking is a cornerstone of the economy, thanks to OEMs like Stellantis and Renault — is reportedly pushing back against the terms. It could mean a longer battle over the specific deadlines and emissions reductions targets. It’s an interesting question, whether a technology ban is the best path forward to achieve some end goal (in this case, lowering carbon emissions). That seems like the stick. I’ll be looking out for the honey — how legislators are going to sweeten the deal for consumers and automakers alike, so there can be as few jobs lost as possible and as many new EVs purchased. For what it’s worth, I read an interesting post from Christian Brand, associate professor in the Transport Studies Unit at Oxford University, who argues that the focus on EVs is slowly down the path to zero emissions. He points out that as many as 50% of car trips are less than five kms (3.11 miles), so he suggests cities should invest in making areas more micromobility friendly to encourage more people to take up these forms of transport. Food for thought. Speaking of carbon emissions, there’s a new partnership between eVTOL developer Joby Aviation, aircraft carrier JetBlue Airways and Signature Flight Support to help develop a new system for carbon credits in the aviation industry. Right now, there’s no current pathway for companies like JetBlue to purchase carbon credits from green aviation companies, probably because they’re just so new. The three companies will “define the framework for the creation, validation and eventual use of these new credits on aviation carbon markets, including identifying a third party to oversee and validate transactions,” a news release said. The companies anticipate releasing more details later this year. This could be a very profitable development for Joby. Tesla, for example, made $518 million in revenue from the first quarter of 2021 alone from selling regulatory credits to other automakers. — Aria Alamalhodaei Let’s get right to it. Here’s what else happened this week. Audi, BMW, Denso and chipmaker NXP have partnered on an international working group aimed at defining a safe automated driving system architecture for self-driving vehicles. The inaugural group, which was actually created last month but that I’m just sharing with you now, is being spearheaded by The Autonomous. Companies from the industry are invited to learn more about this cross-industry collaboration at The Autonomous Main Event on September 29, 2021. Volkswagen laid out a plan to ramp up its software, mobility as a service and battery tech to stay competitive in the coming decades. CEO Herbert Diess said the strategy will cover everything from manufacturing to revenue streams. Volkswagen’s new business strategy puts software and autonomous driving front and center  Electrify America, the entity set up by Volkswagen as part of its settlement with U.S. regulators over its diesel emissions cheating scandal said it will double the number of its electric vehicle fast charging stations in the United States and Canada by the end of 2025. The commitment, if successful, means 1,800 fast charging stations — or 10,000 individual chargers — will be installed and operational by that time. GM and its new EV business unit BrightDrop are launching a fleet-charging service as the automaker aims to ramp up its bet on connected and electric commercial vehicles. The service, branded Ultium Charge 360 fleet charging service offers many of the tools that a commercial delivery, sales or motor pool business might need. It also includes an effort to add home charging for drivers. GM to launch fleet charging service to power commercial EVs, even at home  Rivian pushed back deliveries of its long-awaited R1T electric pickup truck and R1S SUV several more months due to delays in production caused by “cascading impacts of the pandemic,” particularly the ongoing global shortage of semiconductor chips, according to a letter sent to customers from CEO RJ Scaringe. The R1T deliveries will begin in September with the R1S to follow “shortly,” Scaringe wrote in the message. The National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration issued an alert recommending owners of Chevrolet Bolt Model Year 2017-2019 park their vehicles away from homes due to the risk of fire. Those are the same vehicles that were recalled in November 2020, due to the possibility of fire from the battery pack underneath the backseat’s cushion. The recall affected 50,932 2017-2019 Chevy Bolt vehicles. Mark Moore, who was most recently director of engineering at Uber Elevate until its acquisition by Joby Aviation, launched his own company called Whisper Aero.

Startups and investors are turning to micromobility subscriptions,https://techcrunch.com/2021/07/21/why-startups-and-investors-are-turning-to-micromobility-subscriptions/,"Amid the chaos of the COVID-19 pandemic and the murky path to profitability for shared electric micromobility, an increasing number of companies have turned to subscriptions. It’s a business model that some founders and investors argue hits the profit center sweet spot — an approach that appeals to customers who are wary of sharing as well as paying upfront to own a scooter or e-bike, all while minimizing overhead costs and depreciation of assets.  

			Many investors think the subscription model will broaden the micromobility market, positioning it essentially as a software-as-a-service business, which achieves a higher multiple.					

 Across the United States, Europe, some of Canada and at least eight Middle Eastern cities, existing mobility companies are adding a subscription business line to their repertoire, and entirely new companies are being formed on the basis of the hardware-as-a-service model. But will this new playbook push the unit economics of micromobility in a positive direction? And what will determine which companies win at the subscription game? In general, subscriptions for everything from groceries and streaming video to exercise equipment and clothing are on an upward slope. Subscription businesses are expected to grow at a rate of 30% this year, according to a 2021 study by digital services monetization company Telecoming. Micromobility vendors keen to follow other industries into this model are focused on several factors, according to experts following the industry: the ease of scaling, return on investment and cost-per-mile to operate. “Subscription services for a single vehicle are far more interesting and scalable than the subscription model that was trialed by the shared mobility services,” Oliver Bruce, angel investor and co-host of the Micromobility Podcast with Horace Dediu, told TechCrunch. “The cost per kilometer is just an order of magnitude smaller, and it’s not constrained by citywide caps.” Shawn Carolan, managing director at Menlo Ventures, is also bullish on the micromobility subscription model because it makes more sense for the consumer, as most people will prefer to pay a low monthly fee rather than a higher upfront fee. “The best customers are repeat customers, commuters or local neighborhood trips,” Carolan said. “Repeatedly paying per ride is both expensive and cognitively taxing. People want low friction in transportation. Getting from here to there shouldn’t require a lot of thought.” Bird and Lime might dominate the shared micromobility space, but they’re not leading the subscription market, largely because their bikes and scooters are built to be heavier and more robust in order to handle city usage. Their operating systems are also designed to manage fleets and keep the vehicles in specific territories within a city. Bird and Spin have announced intentions to offer subscriptions, but so far there’s only been a chance to sign up for a waitlist. Meanwhile, subscription services tend to offer lighter-weight vehicles that can be carried up flights of stairs or even folded down. Swapfiets, the bike-sharing company with the distinctive blue front wheel, is one of the pioneers in the world of bike-sharing. In 2015, Richard Burger, Martijn Obers and Dirk de Bruijn started the Dutch company as university students in Delft when they realized that owning a bike could be somewhat of a hassle. The Netherlands is renowned for having more bicycles than people, but that doesn’t make it any easier to buy, sell and maintain them, especially with such high fees at bike shops. “We asked how we could shift this and get only benefits from using a bike to go from A to B and not have all this hassle,” Burger told TechCrunch. “And for us, the subscription model was really the realization that would fix that.”  Swapfiets is now operating in nine countries and roughly 60 cities throughout Europe and has expanded from regular bicycles to e-bikes. It has even launched some pilots for e-scooters and e-mopeds in certain cities. Dockless shared e-moped company Revel announced in February that it would add an e-bike subscription to its business. Customers interested in subscribing to its pedal-assist WING bikes have been relegated to a waitlist because demand is outpacing supply, the company said. For now, Revel’s e-bikes business is limited to customers in New York City, with the exception of Staten Island. Other notable companies selling subscriptions include BuzzBike in London, which only rents out pushbikes; Dance in Berlin; Bive in Madrid, Valencia and Sevilla; and Zygg in Toronto. Australian-born Zoomo, which just secured $12 million in an interim capital raise, has geared its subscriptions more toward gig economy workers and enterprise delivery fleets. With these new funds, it’s looking to expand its consumer offerings, as well. In the world of e-scooter subscriptions, Unagi has pushed to be the frontrunner. The startup was launched in 2018 by former Beats Music CEO and MOG co-founder David Hyman. “We were looking at other hardware-as-a-service plays, asking ourselves if there was a market for subscriptions around e-scooters,” Hyman said. “It started as a hunch thinking people would want a Netflix-like experience without commitment.” Unagi announced in March 2021 a $10.5 million funding round, which it used to expand its subscription service to Austin, Miami, Nashville, Phoenix, San Francisco and Seattle, as well as further entrenching itself in the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan regions. The company also sells its foldable kick scooters. Part of its business model is to repurpose returned scooters and use them for subscriptions. Beyond, formerly Brooklyness, raised $1.8 million in seed funding last year. It has a similar ethos to Unagi in that design and high-quality parts are of utmost importance to ensure a premium vehicle with a longer life cycle. Both companies design all components of their vehicles and assemble them in-house. “Our vehicles are designed so they’re super easy to maintain; all the wearable components of the vehicle are easy to access, and we reduce the [number] of components to the minimum,” Beyond founder and CEO Manuel Saez said. “Our thinking is that service or maintenance will be very efficient for us, and in that way, we don’t have a high cost associated with running the service.” Beyond also sells its scooters, and Saez said if someone has been subscribing monthly and decides they want to buy their scooter, Beyond will put the money they’ve already spent toward the sale of the scooter. Similarly, Wire Rides, founded in 2018, offers both subscription and sale of its Ohm e-scooter. It appears to be one of the only companies that delivers to 48 states in the country. “We actually probably have more customers outside of metro areas than inside metro areas,” said co-founder Nick Drombosky, adding that before COVID, they also had college students who would subscribe to scooters for a semester at a time. In 2019, Grover, the German consumer tech subscription service, launched a monthly e-scooter subscription service called GroverGo. It currently offers its own branded e-scooter, the Grover Rush, but it can get subscribers situated with any number of major brand-name vehicles from the likes of Segway-Ninebot, Xiaomi and iconBIT. Abu Dhabi-based e-scooter operator Fenix, which recently launched a 10-minute food delivery service via its shared scooters, also has a subscription business called MyFENIX which is active in eight cities across three countries.  Image Credits: Rebecca Bellan / TechCrunch The field of VCs investing in the idea — and business — of micromobility subscriptions is small and growing. Maniv Mobility, an Israeli VC that specializes in early-stage mobility companies, is one of the more bullish of the firms on subscriptions. The VC participated in rounds for Zoomo, Revel and Fenix. “There are just so many variables because there’s different hardware and there’s different pricing models,” said Michael Granoff, founder and managing partner at Maniv Mobility. “I think the numbers can certainly work, and we’ve seen it a bit alongside free-floating vehicles and the ownership model. We haven’t seen it at scale, though, so I can’t say whether it would work as a standalone business.” Narrative Fund and Brooklyn Bridge Ventures co-led Beyond’s seed round that was announced in December 2020. Social Capital, SOSV and Spacestation, a New York multimedia company, also participated. Menlo Ventures, which has invested in tech wins like Uber, Poshmark and Betterment, led Unagi’s seed round. The firm made a bet that customers would take better care of a high-quality scooter they get to “own” for a time, leading to a longer lifetime for the hardware, Carolan told TechCrunch. “That ultimately translates to higher lifetime value (LTV) per scooter,” Carolan said. “This stands in contrast to the shared-scooter model that typically includes the risk of damage and theft in the price. That cost that traditional scoot-share players incur either gets handed to the consumer via higher price-per-mile (discouraging some riders) and also shrinks the LTV per scooter.” Many investors think the subscription model will broaden the micromobility market, positioning it essentially as a software-as-a-service business, which achieves a higher multiple, according to Carolan. Other investors have put capital toward startups pushing subscriptions, including Dance’s backers HV Capital and BlueYard, which participated in the company’s €15 million Series A last October, and Ponooc, which has a majority share in Swapfiets. Ponooc would not disclose funding amounts. Micromobility’s next big business is software, not vehicles  The business of selling micromobility subscriptions is still fresh, as is the usage of electric scooters and bikes. Experts have forecast growth on both fronts. Subscriptions are likely to make up a third of the micromobility market, with sales and rideshares taking up the other two pieces of the pie, according to a joint study by Unagi and UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business. Meanwhile, outright sales of e-bikes are also projected to rise, leading some companies to try the dual sales and subscription approach. Electric bike sales grew by 145% in the U.S. from 2019 to 2020. In Europe, industry experts have forecast the number of e-bikes sold each year could increase from 3.7 million in 2018 to 17 million in 2030. Simply offering subscriptions doesn’t guarantee a profitable enterprise. Company founders told TechCrunch that diversification, data and analytics, and customer retention are areas being prioritized. “In order to scale to the level that we want to be, we will need to get a lot better at profiling people and being able to target people specifically,” said Saez of Beyond. “We haven’t had that problem so far, as it’s been a lot of referrals. That’s been key for us, and what we’ve been doing is building all the tools to make that easy for them.” Beyond picks up its most valuable data by asking its customers about what they do and how they use the scooters, Saez said. “Seventy percent of our customer base is what we call ‘blue collar,’ so nonspecialized trade, and they use it mainly for commuting,” he said. “Those are people that live in the outer borders that used to walk 20 minutes to the train. Now that just is a quick scoot and they get half an hour to an hour back in their lives.” Customer service and maintenance plans are among the hot opportunities for scooter- and e-bike-adjacent software companies to enter into the market as they’re key to retaining existing subscribers. Some startups such as Beyond are taking those software efforts in-house. Carolan was of a similar mind. With any subscription business that uses an expensive asset, it’s imperative to dial in the unit economics, and that means minimizing fraud and theft and handling repairs and servicing, he said. Keeping up will require continuous improvement, but Carolan said it’s well within the scope of available technologies. “The job to be done is reliability,” Bruce said. “Maintenance and repairs is still a nascent sector, but for people who want to have a reliable option for travel and don’t know or care about how to maintain their brakes or gears, it’s a really good option. Proper servicing will open up micromobility to a far wider group, especially when paired to safe infrastructure and favorable transport policies.” Mobility startups can be equitable, accessible and profitable ","Subscription businesses are expected to grow at a rate of 30% this year. Bird and Spin have announced intentions to offer subscriptions, but so far there’s only been a chance to sign up for a waitlist."
A passwordless server run by spyware maker NSO sparks contact-tracing privacy concerns,https://techcrunch.com/2020/05/07/nso-group-fleming-contact-tracing/,"As countries work to reopen after weeks of lockdown, contact-tracing apps help to understand the spread of the deadly coronavirus strain, COVID-19. While most governments lean toward privacy-focused apps that use Bluetooth signals to create an anonymous profile of a person’s whereabouts, others, like Israel, use location and cell phone data to track the spread of the virus. Israel-based private security firm NSO Group, known for making mobile hacking tools, is leading one of Israel’s contact-tracing efforts. Security researcher Bob Diachenko discovered one of NSO’s contact-tracing systems on the internet, unprotected and without a password, for anyone to access. After he contacted the company, NSO pulled the unprotected database offline. Diachenko said he believes the database contains dummy data. NSO told TechCrunch that the system was only for demonstrating its technology and denied it was exposed because of a security lapse. NSO is still waiting for the Israeli government’s approval to feed cell records into the system. But experts say the system should not have been open to begin with, and that centralized databases of citizens’ location data pose a security and privacy risk. NSO began work on its contact-tracing system codenamed Fleming in March. Fleming is designed to “pour” in confirmed coronavirus test data from the health authorities and phone location data from the cell networks to identify people who may have been exposed to a person with the virus. Anyone who came into close proximity to a person diagnosed with coronavirus would be notified. The unprotected database was hosted on an Amazon Web Services server in Frankfurt, where the data protection regime is one of the strictest in the world. It contained about six weeks of location data, spanning around March 10 to April 23. It also included specific dates, times and the location of a “target” — a term that NSO used in the database to describe people — that may have come into contact with a potentially infected person. The data also included the duration of the encounter to help score the likelihood of a transmitted infection. The login page for NSO’s Fleming is protected with a password. Its backend database was unprotected. (Image: TechCrunch) The login page for NSO’s Fleming is protected with a password. Its backend database was unprotected. (Image: TechCrunch) “NSO Group has successfully developed ‘Fleming’, an innovative, unique and purely analytical system designed to respond to the coronavirus pandemic,” said Oren Ganz, a director at NSO Group. “Fleming has been designed for the benefit of government decision-makers, without compromising individual privacy. This system has been demonstrated worldwide with great transparency to media organizations, and approximately 100 individual countries,” he said. TechCrunch was also given a demonstration of how the system works. “This transparent demo, the same shown to individual countries and media organizations, was the one located on the open random server in question, and the very same demo observed today by TechCrunch. All other speculation about this overt, open system is not correct, and does not align with the basic fact this transparent demonstration has been seen by hundreds of people in media and government worldwide,” said Ganz. John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab, part of the Munk School at the University of Toronto, said that any database storing location data poses a privacy risk. “Not securing a server would be an embarrassment for a school project,” said Scott-Railton. “For a billion-dollar company to not password protect a secretive project that hopes to handle location and health data suggest a quick and sloppy roll out.” “NSO’s case is the precedent that proves the problem: rushed COVID-19 tracking efforts will imperil our privacy and online safety,” he said. As global coronavirus infections began to spike in March, the Israeli government passed an emergency law giving its domestic security service Shin Bet “unprecedented access” to collect vast amounts of cell data from the phone companies to help identify possible infections. By the end of March, Israeli defense minister Naftali Bennett said the government was working on a new contact tracing system, separate from the one used by Shin Bet. It was later revealed that NSO was building the second contact-tracing system. Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a privacy expert and a senior fellow at the Israel Democracy Institute, told TechCrunch that she too was given a demonstration of Fleming over a Zoom call in the early days of the outbreak. Without the authority to obtain cell records, NSO told her that it used location data gathered from advertising platforms, or so-called data brokers. Israeli media also reported that NSO used advertising data for “training” the system. Data brokers amass and sell vast troves of location data collected from the apps installed on millions of phones. The apps that track your movements and whereabouts are often also selling those locations to data brokers, which then resell the data to advertisers to serve more targeted ads. NSO denied it used location data from a data broker for its Fleming demo. “The Fleming demo is not based on real and genuine data,” said Ganz. “The demo is rather an illustration of public obfuscated data. It does not contain any personal identifying information of any sort.” Since governments began to outline their plans for contact-tracing systems, experts warned that location data is not accurate and can lead to both false positives and false negatives. Currently, NSO’s system appears to rely on this data for its core functions. “This kind of location data will not get you a reliable measure of whether two people came into close contact,” said Scott-Railton. Israel is not the only government interested in Fleming. Bloomberg reported in March that a dozen nations were allegedly testing NSO’s contact-tracing technology. A review of the unprotected database showed large amounts of location data points in Israel, but also Rwanda, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Spokespeople for the Saudi, Rwandan and Emirati consulates in New York did not respond to our emails. NSO did not answer our questions about its relationship — if any — with these governments.

(Image: TechCrunch) Saudi Arabia is a known customer of NSO Group. United Nations experts have called for an investigation into allegations that the Saudi government used NSO’s Pegasus spyware to hack into the phone of Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos. NSO has denied the claims. NSO is also embroiled in a legal battle with Facebook-owned WhatsApp for allegedly building a hacking tool designed to be delivered over WhatsApp, which was used to hack into the cell phones of 1,400 users, including government officials, journalists and human rights activists, using AWS servers based in the U.S. and Frankfurt. NSO also rebuffed the claims. Experts have expressed concerns over the use of centralized data, fearing that it could become a target for hackers. Most countries are favoring decentralized efforts, like the joint project between Apple and Google, which uses anonymized Bluetooth signals picked up from phones in near proximity, instead of collecting cell location data into a single database. Bluetooth contact tracing has won the support of academics and security researchers over location-based contact-tracing efforts, which they say would enable large-scale surveillance. Shwartz Altshuler told TechCrunch that location-based contact tracing is a “huge infringement” of privacy. “It means that you can’t have any secrets,” she said. “You can’t have any meetings if you’re a journalist, and you can’t go to places where people want to know where you are.” Favoring their own contact-tracing efforts, Apple and Google have already banned governments building contact-tracing apps utilizing their joint API from using location tracking, fearing that data stored on a centralized server could be breached. Just this week, the U.S. and U.K. governments warned that nation-state hackers are targeting organizations involved in the coronavirus response. Alan Woodward, a professor at the University of Surrey, said location data makes it “possible to build social graphs and to begin identifying who met who, when and where.” “Even if it is just trial data, it’s still sensitive if it’s real people,” he said.

"VCs from Accel and SoftBank talk Europe’s startup scene, what they expect in 2020, and the future of SoftBank",https://techcrunch.com/2019/12/26/vcs-from-accel-and-softbank-talk-europes-startup-scene-what-they-expect-in-2020-and-the-future-of-softbank/,"If you haven’t noticed, Europe’s startup scene is in full bloom, with more than $30 billion deployed in startups across the continent over the last 12 months and more than 20 countries now home to a so-called unicorn company. Investors around the globe are jumping into the pool, too. Consider that the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) is currently investing a €300 million fund in Europe. Abu Dhabi’s state investor, Mubadala, last year announced it was launching a $400 million fund to back European startups. And that’s saying nothing of the many Europe-based venture investors who are either raising new funds or recently closed them. Atomico, for example, one of the continent’s biggest early-stage firms, closed its most recent fund with $765 million in 2017 and is reportedly out fundraising again. Others of all different sizes have recently announced new vehicles, including Balderton Capital, which last month closed a new $400 million fund; United Ventures, a 6.5-year-old, Milan-based early-stage venture capital firm that last week closed its second fund with €120 million in capital commitments (nearly double the €70 million it raised for its debut fund); MiddleGame Ventures, a 1.5-year-old, Luxembourg-based fintech-focused investment firm that recently held a first close on a fund that’s targeting €150 million altogether; Northzone, a 23-year-old, London-based venture capital firm that closed on $500 million in capital commitments for its ninth fund (its largest to date); Ada Ventures, a new London-based seed-stage venture firm that just closed its debut fund with $34 million; and Dawn Capital, a nearly 13-year-old, U.K.-based early-stage venture firm that in summer raised $125 million for an opportunities-type fund. To find out more about what’s happening on the ground, we sat down at Disrupt Berlin earlier this month with two London-based investors —  Carolina Brochado, who late last year left Atomico to join SoftBank’s Vision Fund, and Andrei Brasoveanu of Accel — to discuss where the money is coming from, which European cities are becoming more interesting to both of them, and some of the challenges they face in covering so many different regions. We also talked specifically with Brochado about whether SoftBank is changing up its tactics in light of some bets that aren’t panning out as intended — and whether she has any qualms about the outfit’s biggest investor. Our conversation, edited lightly for length and clarity, follows. TC: We’re all meeting for the first time, and I thought we could do everyone here a service who wants to understand both of you better by talking a little bit about who you are and what you focus on. Do you want to start Carolina? I know you studied in the U.S… CB: Yes, so I’m originally from Brazil. I moved to the U.S. for university, spent over 10 years in the U.S., [and I] have worked in in large cap private equity, have worked at a pre launch, launch, [then failed] startup, and then have spent a lot of my time in Europe, which has been seven years now, at an earlier stage VC firm called Atomico . . . and for the last year, I’ve been at SoftBank Vision Fund, investing at the growth stage. AB: I’ve been with Accel for six years. I’m originally from Romania and spent 10 years in the states like Carolina, studying and working in New York in high frequency trading. At Accel, I’ve been focused most of my time on enterprise software and financial services and I’ve been very excited to back European founders from London all the way to Bucharest. Accel is one of the few Valley-based venture firms with on-the-tground presence in Europe. We’ve been here for 20 years, and we really believe in having a local approach to investing. TC: Carolina, you switched from Atomico to SoftBank this year. Why? CB: There’s a lot of push and pull with these sort of things. Europe is such an incredibly exciting place right now, and to be totally honest, back [when I moved here] in 2013, I didn’t totally see it, but over the years, you realize how many incredible entrepreneurs [are here], how many incredible teams, and the opportunity that lies ahead. And firms like Accel and Atomico were paving the path of the capital structure in Europe, which is actually very young; maybe the past 15 years, there’s been VC in Europe, and now you starting to see the fruits of that and the exits. So for me, part of it was while there are great funds at the early stage, there’s still a lot of underfunding at that later stage, so I was really excited about doing growth in Europe and putting significant amounts of capital behind founders who want to go for the really big outcomes. TC: You now have an insider’s view of these two very important firms. What are some of the biggest differences between Atomico and SoftBank, aside from the different stages at which they invest — how do maybe the processes differ? CB: There’s obviously a difference in size — Atomico was 70 people and SoftBank is a 500-person organization. There is an interesting founder-led approach to both organizations. They are both very mission- driven by founders who want to change the world and by founders who want to be the best at what they do, which is really exciting. One of the key differences at SoftBank is that it’s really global firm [with] offices everywhere. We have offices in the U.S. We have offices in Asia. We have offices in Europe. For me, it has been a really interesting platform to see what other great founders are doing in other places of the world. And then, just because of the sheer size of the organization, you have a group of 50-plus operating partners who may have really deep areas of domain expertise like talent but who are also helping our companies do business development, and who can look at our ecosystem — which today is over 85 portfolio companies —  and make connections, and win business and actually win profitability for companies across and within that ecosystem. TC: You’re both [in Berlin right now] from London. Andrei, do you run into each other in deals, or are your worlds vastly different? AB: I would say we have quite different focus areas, we’re very much early-stage focused as our sweet spot [though] some of our companies, when they get to that mature stage, may benefit from working with SoftBank. CB: We try to stay very close to the great companies at Accel, so they’ll nudge us [when it’s the right time]. TC: Who are you seeing coming into deals who you might not have when you joined Accel in 2014? AB: It’s interesting. Since I joined Accel, the quality of investors in Europe has increased dramatically. So we’ve seen quite a few former operators, for example, [meaning] very successful founders who are now starting the starting their own funds. We’ve seen more family offices enter the industry. We’ve seen more U.S. capital in the market. And in general, I think [all] has helped raise the bar in terms of the quality of capital available to founders across Europe. And many of these folks, especially the local players, have been good partners for us.  TC: I understand there’s also more money coming in from China. I’d seen that Mubadala [from United Arab Emirates] is investing $400 million Europe. What about corporates? Corporate VCs have taken over investing in the U.S. Is that also happening here, or to a lesser degree?

(Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch) CB: Absolutely. It used to be the case that founders had to take flights and go see VCs; they had to go to the Valley or they had to go to Asia. And now, I hear stories about VCs chartering planes to go to remote areas in Europe to meet a really exciting company, right. And I think that corporates are very sophisticated in what they do in their areas of domain expertise and are spending a lot of time with companies, and spending it early [in their trajectories], seeing how they develop early on and maybe co-investing and helping them with partnerships and relationships. TC: And where, other than Berlin, are things kind of bubbling up? Where are you seeing more founders coalescing?  AB: Outside of the obvious ones — like Berlin, Paris Stockholm — many of these companies, especially given the technical universities, pop up from all over the place. We’ve backed amazing companies like UiPath in Bucharest or Celonis in Munich, and we see quite a long tail of really interestinghubs with quality talent where companies emerge from — which also points to why Europe is so hard to cover off the plane. You need a very strong local network and to be here on the ground to find and support these companies early on. CB: One of the areas where we’ve been spending more time on outside of the obvious places is Eastern Europe. There’s a lot of talent, and there have been big winners already, and you’re starting to see increased activity [and] new business models. TC: What are you each of you looking for in order to write a check to a startup? AB: We’re very long-term focused or we’re really love backing original founders folks who have very bold ideas, and we we open our doors as soon as founders are ready to work with us. [In terms of traction or revenue], there’s no-one-size -fits-all formula for successful companies. Many companies we back are pre revenue or even pre product. What we seek is a unique market insight [and] a strong team, but a strong team doesn’t have to be a repeat or very experienced team. We back many teams out of college. [It does have to be] founders with a unique approach to attacking a very attractive market. CB: We’re looking for teams that have technologies that are disrupting a specific sector. We love large sectors that are undisrupted by technology because we believe that [they can have] a large impact — fintech, logistics, mobility, real estate and so on. We do invest a little bit later at the growth stage and [with] larger quantums of money, so we expect the core engine of the business to be working. We expect there to be proven economics in the most mature market, if it’s a marketplace or part of the business, or [we expect] early lighthouse customers. So there isn’t necessarily a parameter on what revenue needs to be, but you do need to show that the capital you’ll be using [will be for] growth, as opposed to finding product market fit. TC: SoftBank has had a rough six months or so. It made a big bet on Uber and it looks like it’s overpaid right now. [It looks] like it overpaid for WeWork right now. It parted ways with Wag after investing a lot of money in the company. Your CEO, Masa Son, recently said [of these missteps] that, “There was a problem with my own judgment. That’s something I have to reflect on.”  Is [SoftBank’s] mission going to change [or] the mandate [or] the scope going forward in 2020? BERLIN, GERMANY – DECEMBER 12: Investment Director at SoftBank Vision Fund Carolina Brochado, Partner at Accel Andrei Brasoveanu and Connie Loizos speak on stage at TechCrunch Disrupt Berlin 2019 at Arena Berlin on December 12, 2019 in Berlin, Germany.

(Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images for TechCrunch) CB: Look, it’s the question on everybody’s mind, so I’ll try to address it. The mission of investing in great teams, in mission-driven companies that are changing the way people live, will not change. And I really appreciate the fact that you said “right now” because SoftBank and Masa himself are very long-term thinkers, and hopefully, the message that founders took away from WeWork and the way SoftBank behaved after the IPO didn’t go forward is that we really will work with founders for a long time, and we will hold stock in the public markets, because we believe that this is a 10-, 20-, 100-year vision. And if we believe that a company will change that sector, we will commit to that. And luckily, we have the amounts of capital where we have the ability to do that, so we won’t be fair-weather investors. We’re really there and we have the infrastructure and the capital to support these companies through thick and thin. TC: Do you want to address the widespread perception that SoftBank might not be able to raise a similar size fund [to its $100 billion debut Vision fund]? You have a lot of resources, but you’ve also deployed a lot of those resources. What happens in 2020? CB: I can’t really comment on the size of the fund. I think we have a really strong relationship with our LPs. It’s a really close relationship. And they’re also aligned on on the vision of the fund. On an execution level, there’s going to be a lot of attention now on things like governance and on things like unit economics, which I think is actually really healthy and really positive. And the Vision Fund is two years old. And people sometimes forget that. So I think there’s a lot of learnings. There is definitely going to be a way forward. And the mission will remain the same. TC: You talked about your LPs. One of these LPs — your [anchor] LP — is Saudi Arabia. There’s been a lot of concern about Saudi Arabia, given the civil war in Yemen, this Washington Post journalist who was murdered. Has the Vision Fund’s relationship with Saudi Arabia changed? Do you have any qualms about deploying money on behalf of Saudi Arabia? CB: Masa has spoken about this publicly right and about what a terrible tragedy that was and the fact that SoftBank doesn’t condone violence in any way. What SoftBank is trying to do is use capital to bring technology to areas of the world that might not have access to that kind of deep level of technology, until the effect that SoftBank is trying to have with that capital is actually quite positive. I think that’s maybe is a message that sometimes gets missed. And you know if you meet Masa, he’s a very inspiring guy, and that really is his life mission and that really is the legacy that he wants to leave, even beyond himself. TC: Andrei, in the U.S., SoftBank is sort of the bull in the china shop, aggravating a lot of investors, driving up valuations in many cases. How is it viewed by Accel? AB: Broader events definitely shed some more focus on running businesses effectively. I would say whether it’s good or lean times or bad times, we’ve always been very focused on building a long-term sustainable business and helping founders focus on the long-term prize. And I think, certain situations in recent times have helped shed more light and kind of focus on having good operational metrics and a path to profitability long term. It doesn’t quite change what we do. We’ve always been focused on building something that’s long lasting.

Alibaba-backed facial recognition startup Megvii raises $750 million,https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/megvii-750-million/,"One of China’s most ambitious artificial intelligence startups, Megvii, more commonly known for its facial recognition brand Face++, announced Wednesday that it has raised $750 million in a Series D funding round. Founded by three graduates from the prestigious Tsinghua University in China, the eight-year-old company specializes in applying its computer vision solutions to a range of use cases such as public security and mobile payment. It competes with its fast-growing Chinese peers, including the world’s most valuable AI startup, SenseTime — also funded by Alibaba — and Sequoia-backed Yitu. Bloomberg reported in January that Megvii was mulling to raise up to $1 billion through an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The new capital injection lifts the company’s valuation to just north of $4 billion as it gears up for its IPO later this year, sources told Reuters. China is on track to overtake the United States in AI on various fronts. Buoyed by a handful of mega-rounds, Chinese AI startups accounted for 48 percent of all AI fundings in 2017, surpassing those in the U.S. for the first time, shows data collected by CB Insights. An analysis released in March by the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence found that China is rapidly closing in on the U.S. by the amount of AI research papers published and the influence thereof. A critical caveat to China’s flourishing AI landscape is, as The New York Times and other publications have pointed out, the government’s use of the technology. While facial recognition has helped the police trace missing children and capture suspects, there have been concerns around its use as a surveillance tool. Megvii’s new funding round arrives just days after a Human Rights Watch report listed it as a technology provider to the Integrated Joint Operations Platform, a police app allegedly used to collect detailed data from a largely Muslim minority group in China’s far west province of Xinjiang. Megvii denied any links to the IJOP database per a Bloomberg report. Kai-Fu Lee, a world-renowned AI expert and investor who was Google’s former China head, warned that any country in the world has the capacity to abuse AI, adding that China also uses the technology to transform retail, education and urban traffic among other sectors. China is beating the US on AI, says noted investor Kai-Fu Lee  Megvii has attracted a rank of big-name investors in and outside China to date. Participants in its Series D include Bank of China Group Investment Limited, the central bank’s wholly owned subsidiary focused on investments, and ICBC Asset Management (Global), the offshore investment subsidiary of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. Foreign backers in the round include a wholly owned subsidiary of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, one of the world’s largest sovereign wealth funds, and Australian investment bank Macquarie Group. Megvii says its fresh proceeds will go toward the commercialization of its AI services, recruitment and global expansion. China has been exporting its advanced AI technologies to countries around the world. Megvii, according to a report by the South China Morning Post from last June, was in talks to bring its software to Thailand and Malaysia. Last year, Yitu opened its first overseas office in Singapore to deploy its intelligence solutions to partners in Southeast Asia. In a similar fashion, SenseTime landed in Japan by opening an autonomous driving test park this January. “Megvii is a global AI technology leader and innovator with cutting-edge technologies, a scalable business model and a proven track record of monetization,” read a statement from Andrew Downe, Asia regional head of commodities and global markets at Macquarie Group. “We believe the commercialization of artificial intelligence is a long-term focus and is of great importance.” ","Megvii, more commonly known for its facial recognition brand Face++, announced Wednesday that it has raised $750 million in a Series D funding round.

How autonomous vehicles and hyperloop are scooting along,https://techcrunch.com/2019/07/18/how-autonomous-vehicles-hyperloop-are-scooting-along/,"Two years ago, Lime was a great addition to guacamole, rather than a sidewalk. The market wasn’t sure about car sharing and whether it had long-term viability. Now, with the acquisition of Drivy, Getaround is the largest car-sharing platform with partnerships the likes of Uber and Toyota. Uber and Lyft were (and are) a phenomenon, but there were still pundits who weren’t sure if Uber would ever overcome the adversity of its culture. At the same time, I wrote a series of four articles on the latest transport technologies, and the waves they would create with perspectives focused on the impact on retail, commercial real-estate, short-haul travel and hyperloop. Among those predictions was the impact hyperloop and autonomous vehicle technology would have on commuting, short-haul air travel and the retail industry. Since then, these technologies have continued to develop and evolve, and it’s worthwhile to revisit assumptions and assertions. Some of the more optimistic expectations put upon them by their proponents have so far failed to be realized, and they are no closer to becoming a reality in our day-to-day lives. This begs the question as to whether they will still become the industry disruptors many pundits, including me, suggested they would, or if expectations have become more tempered. Both hyperloop and autonomous vehicle technology have had their ups and downs over the past two years, but they’re still set to change the way we (and the things we need) travel. When people think about transport innovation, we often think of self-driving cars or, maybe, flying cars. Many believed that we’d be relegated (or promoted) to the back seat as soon as 2020. We would be sitting comfortably while fleets of autonomous cars chauffeured us along. Over the past two years the landscape has consolidated and the players are arguing what’s possible. Driverless cars haven’t managed to achieve some of the targets that were being set for the technology two years ago. For instance, as we discussed, Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed in 2015 that the company’s cars would be fully autonomous by 2017 — a prediction that, of course, didn’t and still hasn’t come to pass as of mid 2019. And in January this year, Nissan — one of the main proponents of autonomous vehicle technology — said “true autonomous cars will not happen within the next decade.” But it would be overly pessimistic to suggest the technology isn’t coming at all. The progress has been incredible.  

			Disruptive leaps forward often result in a net gain in employment.					

 Ford CEO Jim Hackett said that “[w]e overestimated the arrival of autonomous vehicles,” at an April 2019 Detroit Economic Club event. Ford believes its fully driverless cars will be in commercial operation by 2021, and the technology has remained a major and consistent talking point in the media. At the annual WSJ conference, D.Live, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said that “autonomy will always have constraints,” to communicate his belief that fully autonomous Level 5 transport is not coming anytime soon. Industry pundits like the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) would argue that Waymo is leading the pack on unlocking the promise of autonomous technology. Tesla’s founder and chief, Elon Musk, feels that Teslas will leapfrog Waymo with an upgrade in 2020 that will make more than a million cars fully autonomous. “By the middle of next year, we’ll have over a million Tesla cars on the road with full self-driving hardware, feature complete, at a reliability level that we would consider that no one needs to pay attention.” My excitement is tempered by the fact that Musk said before that Teslas would be fully autonomous by 2017. That said, I wouldn’t slight him for being audacious, as I do believe he was just being overly optimistic rather than scamming the market. We shouldn’t forget everyone’s favorite punching bag, Uber, which entered the race in 2015 when they first partnered, then acquired, an entire Carnegie Mellon autonomy lab. Their foray into self-driving abruptly stopped after a tragic accident that killed a pedestrian in Arizona. At this point, it would seem more likely they are going to use the technology rather than develop it themselves. In my piece titled “Transport’s coming upheaval,” published in the original series on TechCrunch, I suggested that new modes of transport, such as autonomous vehicles and hyperloop, would end up creating more jobs than they would eliminate. They, coupled with improvements in remote work technologies, should contribute to lowering the cost of human capital by allowing them to comfortably move outside of urban centers to lower-cost housing. Job loss has been one of the common themes in the discussion around the innovative transport technologies. Some reports have suggested that autonomous vehicle technology could destroy 300,000 jobs a year, and that hyperloop would have a devastating effect on the trucking industry. But as I previously posited, history shows us that, more often than not, disruptive leaps forward often result in a net gain in employment. Take, for instance, the introduction of the personal computer in the 1970s. It initially destroyed 3.5 million jobs in total, including those in typewriter manufacturing, secretarial work and bookkeeping. But it went on to help create 19.3 million jobs, in the U.S. alone, across a wide range of industries and occupations, according to McKinsey estimates. New transport innovations will have a similar effect, creating many new jobs. Even though driverless cars aren’t yet available for commercial purchase, there have been developments with the technology that give us a better idea as to how it will likely affect global workforces.  

			Rather than be a disaster for the world of work, autonomous vehicles and hyperloop could be a boon for employees.					

 As a whole host of companies, including Waymo, Tesla, Cruise and Ford, strive to make a breakthrough with autonomous vehicle technology, more workers are required to make the driverless car dream a reality. According to the online talent platform ZipRecruiter, the number of job listings related to driverless cars increased 27% year over year in January 2018, and the amount of job postings in the autonomous vehicle sector rose by 250% from the second quarter in 2017 to the second quarter in 2018 due to a hiring spree at the beginning of the year. Indeed, a report from Boston Consulting Group and Detroit Mobility Lab released in January estimated that self-driving and electric cars would create more than 100,000 jobs in the U.S. over the next decade. In fact, the trucking industry seems ripe for change, and not just because of the benefits that autonomous vehicle technology would bring. There is a shortage of truck drivers in the U.S., according to CNBC. The unemployment rate fell to 3.9% percent in July of last year, meaning companies are struggling to recruit for a job that has long, demanding hours. Drivers for both trucking and autonomous taxis won’t be irrelevant for some time. For trucking, there is a need for a human to secure the cargo and manage the many checkpoints. For taxis, if Waymo’s CEO is correct, there will still be routes where the driver may be needed, especially in high traffic cities with variability in routes, road quality, construction and traffic conditions. As the new transport technologies are slowly introduced, they will indeed eliminate existing jobs after, first, making them much more enjoyable for the workers. But evidence suggests that those jobs will be replaced by new ones that require different experiences and levels of education. Rather than be a disaster for the world of work, autonomous vehicles and hyperloop could be a boon for employees everywhere. Two years ago, there was a ton of buzz around what Elon Musk once deemed a “fifth mode of transport.” Hyperloop — a form of terrestrial travel where pod-like vehicles travel in near-vacuum tubes at more than 700 mph — was set to be up-and-running by 2020, with plans to create routes between San Francisco and LA, and Washington and New York. The impact of this, as I discussed in my original transport series, would be huge for commuting and real estate, and would be a devastating disruptor for short-haul air travel and some trucking routes. Even though hyperloop isn’t being talked about in the same way it was, the promising global projects are far from dead. There are still plenty of developments that suggest hyperloop could be a major form of transport in the future. Virgin Hyperloop One is now testing empty pods along its 1,640-foot-long, 11-foot-high tube just north of Las Vegas; and in October last year, Hyperloop Transportation Technologies (HTT) unveiled its first full-scale capsules, which it believes will be passenger-ready by the end of 2019. However, many of the widely publicized Hyperloop routes — LA to San Francisco, and Washington to New York — have gone cold in recent years. As have plans to create a high-speed rail across California. In February, California Governor Gavin Newsom said that plans for the new track had been scaled back from the previous grand ambition to connect north to south, saying that, “The project, as currently planned, would cost too much and take too long.”  

			Efficiency isn’t the only factor that would put self-driving in good stead against airline competitors. 					

 The financial problems the California high-speed rail track has come up against could be an ominous sign for hyperloop technology in the U.S. These types of transport systems are often vastly expensive (the California high-speed rail project was set to cost $68 billion, if completed), and there’s no guarantee they’ll return the investment. Taiwan’s high-speed rail, for instance, suffered heavy losses due to depreciation charges, interest burdens and lower-than-expected demand. And while Elon Musk claimed the LA to SF hyperloop track would cost as little as $6 billion, the SpaceX founder’s estimates have been largely rebuked, with some critics claiming the track would actually cost closer to $100 billion. Hyperloop is becoming a commercial reality as soon as 2021, just not in the United States. HTT will be building a 10 km track to connect Abu Dhabi to Al Ain and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. The hope is to be operational by the universal exposition, Expo 2020, on October 20th, 2020. Clearly, hyperloop still has a lot of questions to answer if it is to fulfill the expectations placed on it, but leaving the technology by the wayside without further testing would be foolish when taking into consideration the environmental and commuting benefits hyperloop would bring. If the technology proves to be cost efficient and as effective as its proponents have previously claimed, it will still have a huge impact on how we and our cargo travel. I continue to believe that self-driving technology will disrupt short-haul air travel in a massive way. Why would you go through the hassle of airport security when a terrestrial mode of transport could get you to your destination even quicker? Efficiency isn’t the only factor that would put self-driving in good stead against airline competitors. Commuting would be easier, too. In all likelihood, traveling by car would be more comfortable and spacious than air travel, but it would also be more amenable to good Wi-Fi connection. In the two years since writing the original series on innovations in transport, in-flight Wi-Fi has improved, but it’s often costly and leaves much to be desired.  

			Autonomous vehicles will be the next step in brick-and-mortar retail innovation. 					

 Volvo, for instance, released an autonomous car concept in September last year of an electric vehicle that can double up as a living room, bedroom and office. The car, named the 360c, benefits from a larger interior thanks to its lack of a bulky combustion engine and steering wheel. The 360c can be configured in four different ways, with spacious seating, a table and a fold-away bed. This type of travel would revolutionize how we commute. Workers traveling long distances would surely choose to spend more time in a spacious, work-friendly driverless car than by air travel, if it meant they could comfortably work en route. And it’s a vision that automotive companies with an eye to autonomous vehicle technology are considering seriously. As we’ve already seen, the claim that new transport innovations such as driverless cars and hyperloop will destroy more jobs than they’ll create is specious at best. But that doesn’t mean the technology won’t change certain roles in the sector. Already, the role of driver in ridesharing companies is beginning to change and become more enterprising. In July last year, in-car commerce startup Cargo partnered with Uber. The deal allows drivers to sell passengers candy, cosmetics and electronics during the journey. And, according to Cargo’s estimates, drivers using its service can earn between $1,500 to $3,000 in extra income per year. As cars become more autonomous and the form-factors evolve, it will allow the drivers to provide more services to passengers. This type of new mobile retail could go on to sell far more than just a few select products in an Uber, though, and it may have a knock-on effect on the retail industry as a whole — an assertion I made in the original series. Two years ago, retail was suffering badly and, in large part, that trend continues as many fail to adapt. Today, it’s still in a state of flux, with constant disruptions threatening the future of brick-and-mortar stores. Those stores that are surviving the onslaught are adapting and improving with the latest technology. For instance, many companies, such as Ikea, are using augmented and virtual reality to make the shopping experience more immersive.  

			The reality is that scooters, e-bikes and other modalities will continue to infiltrate our cities. 					

 Autonomous vehicles will be the next step in brick-and-mortar retail innovation. The technology could allow fleets of stores on wheels to come to consumers on demand straight to their location. When I made the claim two years ago, it may have seemed a bit far-fetched, but since then, plenty of businesses have started utilizing the concept. Walmart, Ford and Postmates are reportedly collaborating on a pilot program in Miami where goods will be delivered to consumers’ doors in a driverless vehicle. They aren’t the only ones exploring how to use the technology in retail. In mid-2017, Swedish company Wheelys launched Moby Mart — a fully autonomous, staffless supermarket on wheels. The service currently operates in Shanghai, China, and is available 24/7. Consumers have shown an increasing appetite for on-demand food delivery services since I wrote the original series. Uber Eats is only three years old, but it’s already valued at $20 billion; and one of its main rival, Postmates, made more than 35 million deliveries in 2018. As autonomous vehicle technology becomes more widely adopted, more businesses will see the advantage in using it to deliver efficient services to a growing customer base. E-bikes have been a steadily growing market since the end of the 20th century, but with the help of on-demand bike sharing they’ve exploded in major cities. Meanwhile, another form of transport left the playground and moved mainstream. Scooters have long been a staple, but since 2017, they’ve changed the landscape of short city commutes. According to a report released by the National Association of City Transportation Officials, riders took nearly 39 million trips on shared electric scooters in 2018. For the first time they surpassed e-bikes by nearly 10%. The biggest names behind the scooter boom in the U.S. are Lime, Bird and Scoot. Ironically, their scooters are powered by inventor Dean Kamen’s technology that was at the heart of the Segway. It only took nearly two decades for his future to be realized with a slight design change. Although I’m not clear that the scooter rental companies are as big a financial opportunity as their investors are hoping, I do believe they aren’t going anywhere. The reality is that scooters, e-bikes and other modalities will continue to infiltrate our cities as urban planners move away from designs centered around automobiles. With the setbacks and failed predictions that have been made of autonomous vehicles and hyperloop technology, it would be easy to be skeptical if they will come at all. But, as is often the case with innovation and change, adoption can be slow, and there are often unforeseeable delays. However, with so many startups and major global businesses — from Waymo to Virgin — betting heavily on the future of hyperloop and autonomous vehicles, it’s surely a question of when rather than if they come to pass. As we’ve seen, these technologies have made huge strides in the two years since I wrote the original series, and the applications of them are starting to be realized. And those applications go far beyond faster, more convenient travel. As more businesses sit up and take notice of the potential driverless cars and hyperloop have to offer, they will continue to shape the future of transport, retail, work and much more.","Two years ago, Lime was a great addition to guacamole, rather than a sidewalk. Now, with the acquisition of Drivy, Getaround is the largest car-sharing platform with partnerships the likes of Uber and Toyota. Both hyperloop and autonomous vehicle technology have had their ups and downs over the past two years."
"Blood capital, WeWork whisperings, and gobs of cash for smiles and vegetables",https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/12/blood-capital-wework-whisperings-and-gobs-of-cash-for-smiles-and-vegetables/," Hello and welcome back to Equity, TechCrunch’s venture capital-focused podcast, where we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. This week we had a good crew on the show. We had Connie Loizos and Danny Crichton from TechCrunch, I scampered over from the Crunchbase News domicile, and Brian O’Malley, a general partner with Forerunner Ventures, joined us to us to round out the collective. It was yet another packed episode. There’s so much going on in the venture world that we can’t get to it all. Not even a large fraction, really. So we did what we always do, and picked out our favorite bits. Up top we talked about the recent market carnage. It’s been super rough for tech stocks large, small, medium, and SaaS. Everyone got hit. O’Malley gave us the standard venture answer that he isn’t a public market investor when we asked him about it, but as public market valuation multiples impact private market valuation multiples, this stuff matters to investors and founders alike. Next up: What’s going on with WeWork and the Vision Fund? After some back and forth, it seems that world-famous capital cannon won’t pick up a majority stake in the starkly unprofitable shared-offices concern. But the saga demonstrates that the Vision Fund is more willing than ever to cut checks the size of small continents. Where the Vision Fund gets its capital, though is under increasing scrutiny. After the apparent murder of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents  in an embassy in Turkey, Saudi money is quickly becoming radioactive. Talking personally for a moment, perhaps it would have been better if the U.S. tech industry, famous for claiming to be more interested in improving the world than paying a dividend, hadn’t taken so much money from the ruling monarchy of a country famous for terrible treatment of women and LGBTQ folks, and for having an overdeveloped taste for the death penalty. Regardless, there was even more news to get through. Forerunner itself recently raised a pretty penny, Egnyte is now $75 million richer thanks to Goldman Sachs, and two Chinese rounds clocked in at a combined $1 billion, give or take. Crazy times. Thanks for listening, as always, and have a great weekend. Get some rest. We all need it.

Here’s the transcript for Equity, if you’d rather read the conversation: Connie Loizos:              Hi and welcome to Equity. I’m TechCrunch’s Connie Loizos. This week we have TechCrunch’s Danny Crichton. Danny Crichton:           Hi. Connie Loizos:              Crunchbase News’s Alex Wilhelm. Alex Wilhelm:              Hello everybody. Connie Loizos:              And this week our special guest is Brian O’Malley a general partner with Forerunner Ventures. Brian, thank you so much for coming. Brian O’Malley:             Hey Connie, thanks for having me. Connie Loizos:              Great to see you. Danny Crichton:           All right, so before we get into the regular topics, kind of the venture world that we usually talk about, I want to do a digression unto the public markets because in the last 48 hours they’ve been leading the headlines. You’re listening to this probably on Friday. It’s Thursday right now, and this has been the second day kind of catastrophic declines in the public markets. The NASDAQ, S&P and the Dow, not to mention global indices if you’re listening somewhere else, have all taken pretty significant damage. Just some top-level numbers, I think the Big Five tech companies, so that’s Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google and Microsoft or Alphabet, Microsoft, yesterday lost about a hundred and ninety billion in combined market caps. Today they’re off about 24. So that’s an enormous bout of value deletion. And this trickles back down all the way to the SaaS market and a lot of other kind of tech genres. So I was kind of curious what we all felt while this was going on. I couldn’t stop watching CNBC. Connie Loizos:              Well, first of all, did anybody pull an IPO this week? Or in the last two days that was planning to go out? Do anybody know? This would be the worst day to go public. Danny Crichton:           Anaplan’s going out soon, right? Connie Loizos:              Yeah, is it going out right this second, or? Alex Wilhelm:              They could be pricing this afternoon. This is what happens when I’ve had a crazy day. I’m a little bit behind. But Anaplan’s final I think it was in September. Definitely a long planned offering, and they filed when the sun was shining. They weren’t expecting the flash flood, I don’t think. Connie Loizos:              No, no. There was another one. A Philadelphia based maker of lithium batteries that strangely spun off earlier this year from a pesticide maker called FMC called Livent, and I know that its shares from today- Brian O’Malley:             Sounds like a madliv right there. Alex Wilhelm:              A battery company in Philadelphia from a pesticide company in Georgia. Connie Loizos:              Yeah, yeah, exactly. Oranges, bananas. Brian O’Malley:             Eating bananas. Alex Wilhelm:              And a division fund comes and buys all of it. The only other IPO that I knew of was Yay-yo. It was just Y-A-Y-Y-O, which is that company that used to help people rent cars to use Uber and Lyft. Brian O’Malley:             Is that little John’s company? Alex Wilhelm:              I don’t know, but it’s also a cocaine joke, because yay-yo is slang … Anyways it’s terrible. Connie Loizos:              Is it? I don’t know that. I’m so old, I guess. So wait, wait. Is that a Chinese company that went public here, or that’s a US company? Alex Wilhelm:              It’s an American company that’s trying to go public here. It’s been on the IPO calendar for a little bit, and it’s never actually managed to get off the IPO calendar. So I don’t think it’s going to go out. So that one might get pulled, but I wouldn’t say it’s because the S&P took a dive. I think because it’s a terrible business. Connie Loizos:              But what’s happening right now? What’s driving this? There’s been a lot of awfulness for a long time. A lot of uncertainty, tariff war we’ve having. Brian, do you have any idea? What sparked this latest? Brian O’Malley:             Sure, so my day job is not a public market investor, but I can be like the rest of us. Alex Wilhelm:              Welcome to equity. We don’t care what you do. Brian O’Malley:             Actual knowledge need not apply. Yeah, if you look, the multiples are way up on a historic basis. Connie Loizos:              Right. Brian O’Malley:             There’s questions about interest rates. So that has caused some people to think about whether it’s time to hit the pause button. And usually when people start selling, other people jump on board … Connie Loizos:              Right, right. Contagion. Brian O’Malley:             Because no one really knows what’s going on on a day to day basis. So it’s either a great time to buy, or it’s a good time to run for the hill. Connie Loizos:              You know it’s interesting, speaking of a good time to buy. I was looking at a Business Insider story earlier today. It was talking about all the people on Robinhood, this trading app that let’s … Millennials especially I think is their target audience … Trade for free, and a lot of them are buying up Tesla right now. I think they said a hundred and eleven thousand people on Robinhood have bought it because Tesla has … It’s off, I don’t know how many percent, from its high, and I guess they see it as a buying opportunity. Things are off. It will be interesting to see how quickly they go back. Brian O’Malley:             Yeah. It’s always scary when people’s stock picking decisions are based on funny Tweets, as opposed to business fundamentals. Connie Loizos:              Right, right, absolutely. Brian O’Malley:             We’ll see. Alex Wilhelm:              People are very, very dumb. Danny, are people panicking in the streets of New York? Is there chaos? Are there riots? Is there street signs? What’s going on? Danny Crichton:           There’s rain in New York, so no one’s going outside, Alex. But I will say in covering the Chinese tariff battle, I think it’s still the massive underpinning for this market change. You look at some of the discussions particularly in the last week, whether it’s the Bloomberg story about this chip, or non-chip as it might be. We also had a Wall Street Journal report, I think in the last 24 hours, that the Justice department has arrested the first Chinese spy for industrial espionage. So it looks like it’s going to get more hard and more intense. I think for the global market there’s just a lot of concern all around the board. Alex Wilhelm:              I mean Thomas … I’m going to mispronounce his last name. Tongus, from Redpoint Ventures. One of the more, I think, intelligent investors in the SaaS base. He has a very great personal blog, kind of going over his view on SaaS metrics and economics that everyone tends to read. He had a great post out on the 9th of October, discussing the rise and public multiples for SaaS companies, and how far they are outside of historical norms. So my thesis about why this happens is that it had to happen some time, why not now? We’ve pushed things so far for so long, now that the rubber band’s snapping back, maybe just for a couple of days even. I’m surprised that we’re surprised at this. This should happen more often we’re this far up. Brian O’Malley:             I almost say it’s the opposite. I think we’re surprised that it took this long in the first place. Connie Loizos:              Right, right, right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Danny Crichton:           Amen. Brian O’Malley:             Right? So then you start to forget about the fact that this can happen. Usually these are good times where some companies struggle. Other ones that have the right fundamentals … One of the main reasons why public market investors love SaaS companies is because of their predictability. And a lot of those macro trends still have a long way to go. So the right companies will persevere. It was like buying NetSuite and Salesforce in 2009 in December. It was a pretty good time to buy. Many of those stocks are up 20, 30x since then. Alex Wilhelm:              Yeah I think, as always, good businesses will be fine. It’s kind of the old joke, who can raise right now? Only the good companies. It’s always true. Brian O’Malley:             Actually everyone can raise right now. Alex Wilhelm:              I just got burned by a venture capitalist. This is a new low in my life. It’s a phrase you can use it any point in the business cycle, but I do agree, it sounds very silly now. Alex Wilhelm:              On that point, let’s talk about WeWork. Connie Loizos:              Yes, speaking of raising money. We don’t know what’s happening yet, but SoftBank and its massive 100 million, or I guess 93 million … Billion, excuse me, billion Vision Fund. Brian O’Malley:             Dr. Evil. Connie Loizos:              Exactly. It’s apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal, talking to WeWork about taking a majority stake in the business. I don’t know what that means exactly, but they plan to pour a whole bunch of money in it. So SoftBank has already invested something like 4.4 billion dollars in WeWork, which is that co-working space that’s taking over the universe. According to the Wall Street Journal, now it’s talking about … SoftBank’s talking about investing another 15 to 20 billion in the company. This is enormous for … Literally and also figuratively. This will be a quarter of SoftBank’s fund, which is pretty crazy that it would invest so much in this company. Connie Loizos:              Also it’s interesting because … I don’t know what this means with the company. If this means that Adam Neumann would be … I don’t know what it would mean for the management of the company. Brian, what do you think of the deal? [crosstalk 00:07:42] Brian O’Malley:             Yeah I think there’re three things that are kind of interesting here. The first of which is just the sheer dollars involved. I remember when the [inaudible 00:07:51] team put 50 million dollars into Lyft, and we all thought it was nuts. Connie Loizos:              Exactly. Brian O’Malley:             So we’re talking about over 10 billion dollars into a company. It’s really because SoftBank is not a venture capital firm. They’re not an equity firm. They’re really looking at broader market trends, and macro trends, and being able to put massive amounts of money to work, which is something that, if you’re a large enough sovereign wealth fund, they’re really the only game in town that can put that much money to work, and actually have a strategy for returning it. Connie Loizos:              What do you think of WeWork? And I had a chance to sit dow with Adam Neumann a couple of … I guess a Disrupter or two ago. And he really was selling the vision of WeWork as a technology company. Of course I think there’s some debate about how far he is from fulfilling that vision. It’s still very much a real estate company. Do you think even at 20 billion dollar valuation, which is where WeWork is today, sounds reasonable? Brian O’Malley:             Yes, so I would have called WeWork wrong from the get go. When I came up in the venture industry, it was all about asset lite businesses. It was all about driving innovation through technology. I actually invested in a company called Loose Cubes, which is basically leveraging the excess space in offices to create this kind of marketplace. A lot harder than just renting out buildings and leasing it to other people, and ultimately it didn’t work out super well. So I think one of the big things that is different about WeWork, is really not the technology. The technology’s not why people are going there in the first place. And it’s not driving the majority of their revenue. It’s really that they’ve been so amazingly effective at raising capital to date. Their ability to raise cheap capital has been what’s enabled them to create an experience that a lot of people like. It works well from a working environment perspective. Brian O’Malley:             So I don’t know if they have to be a tech company at the end of the day. That might ultimately impact their multiple, but their impact in terms of how people are working, and establishing this trend, is clearly here to stay. Now the question is at the end of the day, are people willing to pay a premium to work at a WeWork? Or, does it get to be become the Starbucks of co-working, and people would rather work in one of the many boutique type offerings that are popping up? So ultimately, it’s a real estate game, as their ability to charge a premium over what that space would lease for otherwise. Connie Loizos:              Right, right. It’s certainly a trend, as you say. That could change. People could decide to go a certain opposite direction. Have you looked at boutique co-working spaces? Is it something that’s ever been interesting to you? Brian O’Malley:             Yeah again I think it’s not … Again, historically I would describe it as not my job to invest in those companies, although again, WeWork would have been a good one to do early on. But it is certainly something that a lot of our companies are looking at. If you think about it, a lot of the issues here is just the way the leases have been structured in these large, urban environments, is that the small companies that have only been around for a year or two, are signing five, seven, 10 year leases, that they know they will never be in those places. They’ll either be long … Far bigger, or they’ll be long out of business. Connie Loizos:              Gone. Right. Brian O’Malley:             And so a lot of what WeWork brings to the table is just the ability to cut that lease into much more digestible chunks, and enable you to flex up and flex down. For small companies, that’s a huge offering. Connie Loizos:              Well the big deal too I guess for the company is getting the big companies now that are doing that as well, because they’ve also bulk up during times like this, where it’s go, go, go for a decade. But in the case of a downturn, they’ve got Microsoft and many other under-priced clients, they can just sort of be like … Alex Wilhelm:              But that flips. We just talked about the market falling apart. Who holds the leases in the end of the day? It’s WeWork. So if all these businesses flex down, as we were saying, they could be left holding the financial bag. And the last numbers in the company are even during this amazing boom time, when co-working is hot, and everyone’s moving into these spaces, they’re still losing oceans and oceans of money on an operating basis. So the company’s managing to not do well right now. Danny, go for it. Danny Crichton:           No I was just going to say, you’re absolutely right. Even just in New York, these are numbers from the Wall Street Journal. There’s 265,000 desks in WeWork, in 287 buildings across five million square feet. So WeWork is now the largest commercial renter in Manhattan. PART 1 OF 3 ENDS [00:12:04] Brian O’Malley:             … in square feet and so WeWork is now the largest commercial renter in Manhattan. And so, any down turn that affects the tech industry, the ad industry, the finance industry, it’d be basically anything, WeWork’s gonna be the one holding those leases and in many cases, they’re 15, 20 year leases. Danny Crichton:           That’s incredibly long. So, that’s two cycles of the business cycle right there. So they’re gonna have to hold these through, good times and bad, twice. Brian O’Malley:             I think one of the things that gotta take a step back and look and say, “Look, what is their ultimate business model?” And today their business model’s been raising gobs of cash, right? And they’re very good at that. And so, that’s created a competitive advantage in their day job but it’s also something that they’ve been very good at, and it’s one of these questions that when you look at venture funds or you look at people that are investing lots and lots of money, is their day job the fees that they’re getting or is the day job the carrier they’re getting? And, sometimes when you look at these startups they might have generated five million dollars of revenue but they’ve raised a hundred million dollars of capital, so their salaries are far more getting paid by the dollars they’ve raised than the customers that they’ve served. Connie Loizos:              Right. Brian O’Malley:             And so, I think WeWork has been very effective at that to-date and the question is, how far in the future do you need to look? And I think that again, they offer a very good product and you can draw a chart where the lines converge and the business all makes sense, but to-date, the biggest thing that was not obvious about WeWork was their ability to raise lots and lots of money compared to a Regus or someone else that historically been in that space and innovated in 20 years. Connie Loizos:              Right. Well, that’s why I think the technology piece, even though it’s minor today, could become more important over time. Basically like like office management and I think they are sort of already licensing that technology to companies that don’t want to necessarily move their employees into WeWork but wanna turn their own spaces into more WeWork like spaces. Anyway, it’s- Danny Crichton:           Yeah. Brian O’Malley:             I think it’s super cool. I think layering software on top of hardware, and these guys are just buildings, think about it however you want, it is neat, but they’re gonna raise more money … I think we can all agree on this … and so, they’re gonna add even more expectations to fulfill and so I’m worried if that technology component can kind of grow into the sort of value, to fill in the valuation gap they’re gonna have. Connie Loizos:              It’s … yeah. They’re definitely … the sands are going through the hourglass. Brian O’Malley:             Yeah. Connie Loizos:              But what’s interesting about this deal too is … so SoftBank, now I guess it was maybe in Recode I saw earlier today them saying, “This is a possibility.” First of all, apparently there’s tension in these talks, so I don’t know what that means exactly, but on top of whatever was already happening, WeWork has to deal now with sort of a reputational hit that SoftBank seems to be in the midst of right now and that’s because of SoftBank’s biggest investor, which his Saudi Arabia, and it’s crown prince Mohammed bin Salman- Danny Crichton:           Or MBS, as we tend to call him. Connie Loizos:              Or MBS, which is a lot easier to say. So, I’m sure listeners have been following this case to some extent, but there is a missing journalist who was most recently a columnist for the Washington Post. He disappeared at the Saudi Embassy in Turkey. He is believed to be dead. He didn’t … there’s footage of him going into the embassy and not coming out. Basically Turkish officials have said that they think MBS was responsible for basically ordering a hit on this guy. We don’t know what happened but either way, it’s sort of kind of brought to the fore the fact that MBS and Saudi Arabia are not like your typical LPs and though money has been coming into the venture industry for quite a while from these sovereign wealth funds, SoftBank has raised so much from this group, forty five billion dollars, and it’s … MBS just last week said he plans to commit another forty five billion dollars to a second Vision Fund. Connie Loizos:              So it’s kind of complicated. Brian, do you have any thoughts about how sort of, I guess VCs and potentially, their founders, should be looking at all this, if at all? I mean, think it’s relevant, but of course it’s easy for me to say, I’m not an investor. Brian O’Malley:             Sure. So as a venture fund, we care a lot about where our money comes. We take a lot of pride in the LPs that we work with, not just because of institutions that they represent, but because of the longstanding relationship that we hope to have with them. But, historically, it’s been something that founders haven’t spent a ton of time focused on. They might look at the venture firm, they might look at how established they are, but very rarely do we get questions in terms of where our money’s ultimately coming from. Brian O’Malley:             And so, even though this whole situation is tragic and it’s still TBD what actually happened, I’m not sure if this is gonna materially change how founders look at working with SoftBank ’cause SoftBank already has several materially different things working with them versus the last big innovator, which in my mind was really DST. And DST’s whole model was showing up and saying, “Look, we’re gonna give the founders a ton of control, we’re gonna write big checks at big numbers, but we’re largely gonna be very passive.” A lot of that money originally emerged from Russia and that wasn’t a huge factor at the time. Connie Loizos:              Right. Right. Brian O’Malley:             But SoftBank is showing up and they’re putting operators on the board seats that have a ton of experience. They’re buying a lot of control of the companies. They typically will have terms on their deals, which are not always the most favorable terms. So I think the focus is still gonna be on that and the right deal with SoftBank could be a huge pro, but the wrong, and I think this is one of the questions that the WeWork team might have around a majority control deal, the wrong deal can ultimately put a company in a more difficult position. Connie Loizos:              Right. Danny Crichton:           But DST was private money out of Russia versus this is public Saudi money. Brian O’Malley:             True. Danny Crichton:           So we’re talking about a private fund of a Russian versus public money from the Saudi Arabian government effectively or ruling family, if you will. Here’s a headline from August 22nd, 2018 from The New York Times: Saudi Arabia Seeks the Death Penalty for Female Activist. This is the country it’s been all along. Why was this ever okay? Connie Loizos:              Well, I … oh, sorry, Danny, go ahead. Danny:                         I was gonna say, I mean, I think one of the challenges we’re facing is as you get to these larger and larger fund sizes, the universe of potential LPs just shrinks massively, right? Like even a Harvard, which has one of the largest, the largest university endowment, probably has a total of maybe 10, 12 billion in alternatives and probably assigns maybe one or two billion total to the venture industry across multiple funds. So, if you wanna raise a 100 billion dollar fund, sovereign wealth, massive wealth managers which come from the oil industry, Russia, from China, you tend to get into a tougher group of LPs that I think the VC has traditionally participated from. Brian O’Malley:             Yeah and I almost wonder if it’s the inverse, right? Which is, “Hey, there’s all this money out there that is looking for some sort of alpha and some place to put itself. It’s looking to diversify away from things like oil, which you can see that the trend line might not be the best on that over many, many decades. And so, the question is, did the funds start out and say, “Where can we go raise this kind of capital?” Or did they start and say, “Hey, there’s all this capital out there, what’s the right sort of vehicle that can be effective in deploying it.” And I remember this conversation, it was really when the unicorns concept started getting going- Danny Crichton:           Like 2014-ish? Brian O’Malley:             2015, 2014-ish. Danny Crichton:           2015. Got it. Brian O’Malley:             And there was lots of questions about whether any one company would be successful, but a lot of people at the time were saying, “Hey, if I could just buy the basket of all of these unicorns, I’d feel really confident in that.” Connie Loizos:              Mm-hmm (affirmative). Brian O’Malley:             And if you think about what SoftBank’s doing,- Connie Loizos:              ATF, basically. Brian O’Malley:             … it’s really buying the basket of these companies … these unicorns, and if you have hundreds of billions of dollars that you gotta put somewhere, it’s not about strategy. Connie Loizos:              Well, also in fairness to MBS, if I can … I can’t believe I just said that. Brian O’Malley:             I cannot wait to hear the rest of this sentence. Connie Loizos:              Another of SoftBank’s really big LPs is Abu Dhabi and it’s Mubadala Investment Company. They’ve got a 15 billion dollar stake in SoftBank and they’re also … stoning is legal, people are disappeared, I mean, so … but, what’s interesting- Brian O’Malley:             People are disappeared. Connie Loizos:              They are. Danny Crichton:           That’s a euphemistic way of saying murder. [crosstalk 00:20:14] Connie Loizos:              I mean, I’m just saying there’s … yeah, a lot. It’s terrible. Danny Crichton:           I mean, we’re talking about theocratic despotic governments that murder their own people. Connie Loizos:              But it is really … these are- Danny Crichton:           With impunity. Connie Loizos:              These are … they’re very different LPs than VCs are used to dealing with. So we’ll see how this plays out over the long-term. But, I will say … wait, wait, wait, I’ve gotta tell you something else. This is an inside tip, but I think it’s interesting. So, Mubadala also established a 400 million dollar fund out here in Silicon Valley a year ago and I’m hearing that they’re kind of like scouting system for SoftBank, which I think is kind of interesting. They’re kind of managing … they’re sort of, I think, making sure that their investment in the bigger Vision Fund is sort of safeguarded by what they’re seeing on the ground here, but I think they’re also … because you sort of feel like how can SoftBank kind of have relationships with these more nascent startups? And I think this is one way that we haven’t talked about on the show. Danny Crichton:           It’s too bad we couldn’t fund the global innovation ecosystem without taking money from theocratic monarchies that murder their own people. Oh, if only we could have done this with moral money. It’s just too bad we couldn’t. What a shame. Connie Loizos:              Well, I also, I’ve written about this actually this week, when I was thinking it really is for the VCs though, like it for the founders with the SoftBank. So, if you don’t take SoftBank’s money, they’re gonna go somewhere else and the VCs probably feel the same way. If they don’t take MBS’s money, he’ll give it to somebody else, so it’s all sort of very ugly. Danny Crichton:           I also think a huge part of it is also MBS did a very good job on sort of the PR launch of his administration. I mean, whoever … he sees power, right? But he wasn’t supposed to be here. His brother was in charge, this is Mohammed bin Nayef, and he does this sort of 24 hour bloodless coup and managed to take over and he’s sort of telegenic, he’s talking about the future and technology and getting Saudi Arabia off of oil. That to me is, I think, was a charm offensive. I mean, I think it really pulled in the Valley and say, “Look, there’s something new here.” I think the challenge with the Valley gets into these more political situations is it just does not have the sophistication of Wall Street or DC to say, “Well, who are we really dealing with?” And, we’re gonna have these issues now. Connie Loizos:              I think they knew exactly who they were dealing with, to be honest. I mean, I feel like he is charming and I’ve heard some of these guys describe him as very much like a … that he feels like a Silicon Valley entrepreneur. But, I mean, they also knew that, to Brian’s point, he was looking to diversify away from oil and that this was a chance to get money into their company. So, I think that was a big part of why they thought he was so attractive. Danny Crichton:           At the end of the day, as a venture fund, you always have the option of deciding of whether you take one person’s or another and so, I don’t think it’s … it’s kind of a cop-out to say … I think a lot of this is that some of this news has come out more recently and as people look to work with different LPs, you just gotta make a judgment call of whether their values line up with your values and take it from there. Connie Loizos:              Right. Danny Crichton:           ‘Cause we ultimately all have the choice of who we take monies from and who we give money to and you wanna make sure that that’s the kind of thing you can look in the mirror and feel really proud about. Connie Loizos:              I know this is not fair, but I hope founders will think more about this too. Speaker 1:                    Applause. And as a concluding note before we move on to whatever’s next on the agenda, Thomas Friedman left NBS and so, with that level intellectual half behind him, what could have possibly gone wrong? And I’m just gonna let that go away. Danny:                         Thanks, Alex. Speaker 1:                    Sorry, this does make me really mad. I know it’s capitalism and that’s fine, I’m a capitalist, but couldn’t we do it without their money? I guess not. All right. Connie Loizos:              Absolutely. Brian O’Malley:             Well it’s interesting, you could say. I think we’re all just so numb from the news cycle in general given how many things are coming out at such a frequency, that you almost get to a point where you just kind of can’t take one more hit and so you put the blinders on and you focus on doing a great job of what you’re doing. Connie Loizos:              Right. Well that’s … sure, sure, sure. Well, that’s a part of this thing too, and I don’t mean to … I know we’re dwelling on it for so long, but, I mean, this story’s gonna go away. If this guy’s never found, it’s gonna be back to business as usual. And the news cycle is … ’cause there’s so much that comes down the pike, in two days, nobody- PART 2 OF 3 ENDS [00:24:04] Connie Loizos:              The new cycle is, because there’s so much that comes down the pike. In two days, nobody’s going to be talking about this again and there’s- Alex Wilhelm:              You know, there’s an enormous hurricane right now and just there’s always so much. And the markets are falling apart and everyone’s raising several hundred million dollars. It’s chaotic. Can we put a pin in the vision front we- Alex Wilhelm:              Hey everyone, don’t forget this episode is brought to you by [Sharespost 00:24:20]. Alex Wilhelm:              Actually, I almost forgot something. Our guest, Ray [Simonte 00:24:27], actually is and I’m trying to fireball between the last topic and this topic. Connie Loizos:              Not just a little though. A lot. Congratulations. Brian O’Malley:             Thank you. We’re really excited. We closed a 360 million dollar fund and we feel like it’s the Goldilocks fund size where it’s big enough that we can lead series A’s. We can be a strong lead investor and have lots of capital there to follow on our founders, regardless of the environment; but small enough where we can still be very aligned with those teams and not force them down the road to taking more capital than they really need to operate their business. Connie Loizos:              Absolutely. For people who maybe didn’t catch where Bryan works, at the outside of this podcast, he works for Forerunner Ventures. Bryan’s been a VC for a long time. He keeps getting poached by firms- Brian O’Malley:             I love the word poached. [crosstalk 00:25:10] My mom actually appreciated that. I think she was the only one in the family that liked the “poached” term. Connie Loizos:              He was with [Battery 00:25:16], then [Excel 00:25:18] came calling and then most recently, Forerunner. He’s known the founder of that firm, Kirsten Green, for 10 or 11 years, but what Forerunner is sort of known for historically, is these really smart prescient bets, and they’ve been small, but they’ve turned out to be great outcomes. Dollar Shave Club, Jet, Bonobos, Warby Parker, Galassia, I mean basically any brand that you’ve just discovered in the last five to eight years, this firm is behind, and probably wrote one of its first checks. Brian O’Malley:             It’s amazing what Kirsten and Yuri and the rest of the team have done. There’s a lot of other companies that are more of the B2B businesses that are powering these companies. About one out of every four dollars we invest, goes into a company that’s maybe a little bit more behind the scenes, but that portfolio is doing as well, if not better than the ones that are more commonly known. Connie Loizos:              I bet. Now, you’re interesting, because you’ve always kind of straddled both worlds. You’ve got like, one of your past investments is Hotel Tonight, but you also have Duetto, a business to business software company. So are you sort of coming in thinking, are you going to be dividing your time between consumer stuff and B2B? Brian O’Malley:             We have a relatively small investment team, there’s six of us. We all are doing the same things and so it’s not my job to come in and have my expertise, where I go off to the side and do my thing. It’s my job to be there right with the team and we’re looking at a lot of great direct to consumer businesses. Some of those are product companies, some of those market places. Some of them are more subscription or media model. We’re really thinking about the changes in the daily consumer life. There’s a lot of conversation about millennials, but you think about Gen-x, I didn’t realize this, Gen-x actually spends more money than millennials or the baby boomer generation, and they’ve largely been forgotten to date. You have Gen-z coming along – Alex Wilhelm:              Why does Gen-x have all [crosstalk 00:27:08] I think I’m the only millennial in this group, Hey I’m a millennial [crosstalk 00:27:10] so what’d you do with all the money. Danny you’re in New York, you’re not in the room. Connie Loizos:              It’s true. I wanted to ask you about teeth, because there was a big teeth deal today. I talked to Mithril, which is an investment firm that’s in San Francisco and moving to Austin soon, but they were talking about how there’s this overlooked generation, the Gen-x, or even beyond, baby boomers. So they had invested in this dental robotics company in Miami, Florida, that performs implant surgery. I guess like 500 thousand people now receive implants each year, which is pretty lucrative. On the other end, what we’re seeing much more of here in Silicon Valley is sort of like, teeth start ups. There was one today called – Alex Wilhelm:              Is this the broader Invisalign world I keep hearing about? Brian O’Malley:             Smile Direct club Connie Loizos:              Sort of, yeah exactly. I haven’t really followed this one that closely – Alex Wilhelm:              It’s a multi-billion dollar company. It’s worth over three, almost four billion dollars. Brian O’Malley:             It’s interesting, these macro trends are large. It’s like everyone’s got teeth, for the most part. In the US, people want straight teeth, so these are big categories. The patents behind Invisalign have come off of patent. A lot of consumer investors have gotten really focused on these concepts of customer acquisition value, cost, and lifetime value. From a pure math perspective, these businesses look really good. I think one of the big questions is just, what’s the underlying asset that you have? Do you have longterm relationships with these customers? What’s the ultimate equity value, which is still TBD for, not Smile Direct specifically, but a lot of these direct to consumer brands. Brian O’Malley:             When we think about it, we look for great products that consumers love, but we also look for founders that have broader vision in terms of how they can shape people’s lives, as opposed to just sell them one product and then go away. Connie Loizos:              You don’t really think about patents, when it comes to direct to consumer things, but you’re involved in a company called [HEMS 00:29:15] that I think is sort of interesting, and I brought it up a couple of weeks ago, because there’s all these sort of Men’s wellness, not all of these, but a couple of them, that have raised a lot of money. One element of HEMS, is that they sell erectile disfunction medicine that was, I guess Viagra had the patent on it and it expired last year, so that’s again, why this space is kind of heating up right now. Connie Loizos:              When you are a company that’s pursuing a patent that’s just expired, I don’t know if you were going after a generic alternative; how much of an advantage does that give you? How much time does that give you to establish a business around it? Brian O’Malley:             When we think about companies, there’s a couple questions. One is, why now? What’s changed recently that’s created an opportunity today versus what maybe wasn’t there a year, two years ago. So far Hims and [Ro 00:30:05] and a few these other businesses, patents have changed, the laws around telehealth have changed, and that’s opened the door, because if you think about it, a lot these categories are things that people don’t advertise that their customer’s in. There hasn’t any brands that have spoken to this use case. It’s something, from again, a lifetime value perspective. For example, Hims, is in the hair loss business. I don’t know if you guys have looked into that. Alex Wilhelm:              They’re the ads in my gym, I see them. Brian O’Malley:             It’s one of these products that once you start using, you literally have to keep using, otherwise all the benefits you’ve gotten today go away. So when we think about lifetime value, there’s kind of nothing better than that. That’s kind of why, now. The question that we also need to answer is, why tomorrow? It’s one thing if you get a wedge in and it helps you acquire some customers and then the cost of customer acquisition gets driven up and the whole market erodes. Brian O’Malley:             So, when we think about these investments, we also want to see teams that are thinking about [ancillary 00:31:02] products, where they can have a bigger relationship. Building brands that ultimately resonate, building differentiated service experiences, and things that will be lasting. Where, if another company comes along and undercuts them by twenty percent in price; the customer doesn’t really care because they like the relationship they have, and they want to keep buying from that one brand. Brian O’Malley:             That’s something we saw with Dollar Shave Club, where it started out with razors. But they ultimately had a whole suite of products, that was one of the reasons Unilever thought it was an interesting company to look into. Connie Loizos:              [Cutting Out Doctors 00:31:31] is also really interesting. In fact – Brian O’Malley:             To clarify, they don’t cut them out, they have their own. Alex Wilhelm:              It’s like medical marijuana companies. They add your own Skype doctor, it’s fantastic. Those were the good days Connie Loizos:              But orthodontists, apparently are not happy with the Smile Direct Club, because they’re saying it violates the law, it allows people to skip in person visits and x-rays. Alex Wilhelm:              Yes it does, but I don’t like getting x-rays. I had to do that recently and it was awful. We are very short on time, but we’re going to shout out a couple of things that we didn’t get to today. Alex Wilhelm:              There’s a Chinese vegetable delivery company that goes from farmer to restaurant called [Mai Kai 00:32:04]. It could be raising 600 to 800 million dollars at a seven billion dollar plus money valuation. It’s a company you haven’t heard of that is explosively large. Just a data point out of China, Ignite raised 75 million – Brian O’Malley:             These things are always refreshers of just how big China is. Alex Wilhelm:              Every time I hear these, I’m like how many people – oh lots of them. It’s a big country. It’s four times as big as this country or something. Alex Wilhelm:              And then another Chinese company that does Airbnb type things raised 300 million and that’s pronounced [Chau Zhou 00:32:33] So much money going on around the world – Connie Loizos:              Danny, just quickly, do you know the market there? Isn’t there like a big company in china that was talking about trying to acquire Airbnb a couple of years ago? Airbnb turned it down. I think the investors were essentially not that happy about it. Like [Tao Tao 00:32:53] or something. I’m just wondering how sealed up the market is or not. Danny:                         Tourists from China going overseas is actually a massively growing market, so if you’ve ever been to D.C. around the White House or anywhere in New York, it’s absolutely exploding. Airbnb just doesn’t have the same access there. What you’re actually seeing, it’s actually a consumer acquisition play, rather than a sort of property piece. What’s interesting is that, that sort of splits the market into two categories. The people who work with Airbnb, and get sort of a Western Europe American clientele, versus those who work with the Chinese. You can image that some properties are being customized to suit those sort of cultural tastes. I don’t recall the specific deal you’re referring to a few years ago. Alex Wilhelm:              One thing I’ll throw in there is that according to the Financial Times, back in 2016, Airbnb nearly bought [Chau Zhou 00:33:42] so there’s a little bit of history. Maybe they should have done that back a couple years ago. Anyway, that’s all we have time for this week, we’ll be back in seven days. Until then stay cool, don’t sell your stocks, Bye! Alex Wilhelm:              Alright everybody, thank you for listening and a big thank you to Connie Loizos, our Producer Christopher Gates, our Executive Producer, Henry Pickavet, and we will see you all right here, next week.    ",Equity is TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast. This week we unpack the numbers behind the headlines. We talk about the recent market carnage. What’s going on with WeWork and the Vision Fund?

"Vevo, the Hulu-for-music-videos, opens up in the UK",https://techcrunch.com/2011/04/26/vevo-the-hulu-for-music-videos-opens-up-in-the-uk/,"Music video site Vevo, which now claims to be the third largest source for video on the web, has opened up in the UK today, including versions of its iPhone, iPad & Android apps hitting their respective local app stores. In September of last year, the site boasted 49 million unique video viewers per-month, with 500 million views in the US and 1.4 billion in the rest of the world. However, that was before it could be accessed in Britain and with Vevo’s doors open across the pond it’s likely we’ll see the site grow further, which could be bad news for local player Muzu.TV. Vevo is a joint venture between Universal Music Group (UMG), Sony Music Entertainment and the Abu Dhabi Media Company, while the site also offers content from EMI. It operates independently with offices in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Detroit and San Francisco.
