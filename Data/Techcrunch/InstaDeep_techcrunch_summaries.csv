BioNTech acquires Tunisian-born and UK-based AI startup InstaDeep for £562M,https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/10/biontech-acquires-tunisian-born-and-u-k-based-ai-startup-instadeep-for-562m/,"German-based biotech company BioNTech SE is set to acquire InstaDeep, a Tunis-born and U.K.-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup, for up to £562 million (~$680 million) in its largest deal yet. Per Financial Times, the German vaccine maker intends to use InstaDeep’s machine learning to “improve its drug discovery process, including developing personalised treatments tailored to a patient’s cancer.” BioNTech is said to pay £362 million — a mix of cash and an undisclosed amount of BioNTech shares — upfront. The remaining £200 million is dependent on how InstaDeep performs in the future, according to the company’s statement. Last January, InstaDeep, founded by Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim in 2014, raised $100 million in Series B financing led by Alpha Intelligence Capital and CDIB. BioNTech was among the participating investors, which also included Chimera Abu Dhabi, Deutsche Bahn’s DB Digital Ventures and Google. The Tunis and London-based enterprise AI startup which uses advanced machine learning techniques to bring AI to applications within an enterprise environment, has offices in Paris, Tunis, Lagos, Dubai and Cape Town. CEO Beguir, in an interview with TechCrunch last year, said InstaDeep uses reinforcement learning, a kind of machine learning that helps design optimization strategies and tackles them simultaneously. Instances where InstaDeep applies its AI tech includes helping a large shipping company to efficiently transport thousands of containers to a railway station or automate scheduling for 10,000 trains. Other examples are the design of advanced therapeutics with silicon and routing components on a printed circuit board. Tunisian enterprise AI startup InstaDeep raises $100M from AI Capital, BioNTech, Google  The company is currently working on a moonshot product to automate railway scheduling with Deutsche Bahn, the largest rail operator in Europe.  In 2019, InstaDeep formed a multi-year strategic collaboration with BioNTech to launch a joint AI innovation lab where they would deploy the latest advances in AI and ML to develop novel immunotherapies. This acquisition is as a result of this long-term partnership that has seen InstaDeep become the centerpiece of a growing portfolio of initiatives around AI and ML at BioNTech. BioNTech intends to use computational solutions to create personalised drugs for cancer patients and according to its CEO Uğur Şahin, “The acquisition of InstaDeep allows us to incorporate the rapidly evolving AI capabilities of the digital world into our technologies, research, drug discovery, manufacturing and deployment processes. Our aim is to make BioNTech a technology company where AI is seamlessly integrated into all aspects of our work.” InstaDeep’s 240-man team will continue to provide its AI and machine learning services to other companies, including Google and Nvidia, per the company’s statement. “AI is progressing exponentially and our mission at InstaDeep has always been to make sure it benefits everyone. We are very excited to join forces and become one team with BioNTech, with whom we share the same culture of deep tech innovation and focus on positive human impact,” said Beguir on the acquisition. “Together, we envision building a world leader that combines biopharmaceutical research and AI with the aim to design next-generation immunotherapies that enhance medical care — thus, helping fight cancer and other diseases.” The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.","Tunisian-born and U.K.-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup InstaDeep is set to be acquired by German biotech company BioNTech SE.

InstaDeep’s acquisition is a classic case of an African startup gone global,https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/31/instadeeps-acquisition-is-a-classic-case-of-an-african-startup-gone-global/,"This January, Germany’s largest vaccine maker BioNTech announced that it had agreed to acquire Tunisian-born and London-headquartered AI startup InstaDeep for up to £562 million, including a performance-tied £200 million tranche investment. InstaDeep’s deal — subject to regulatory approval and expected to close in the first half of this year — is quite intriguing, for a few reasons. First, when completed (at $682 million, adjusted in U.S. dollar terms), it’ll become the largest acquisition deal involving an African or Africa-focused startup, besting prices bargained for Sendwave, DPO Group and Paystack. Second, unlike the other high-profile acquisitions, InstaDeep isn’t a fintech. And third, although early believers who witnessed InstaDeep’s growth from a local firm to a global startup knew it had enough exit options, they didn’t think the acquisition would happen this fast, said Khaled Ben Jilani, senior partner at AfricInvest, one of InstaDeep’s earlier investors, on a call with TechCrunch. In 2019, InstaDeep raised an $8.5 million Series A at a $30 million valuation, according to sources familiar with the round, which AfricInvest led with participation from New York–based Endeavor Catalyst and a broad range of business angels in the global AI industry. The investment was AfricInvest’s first involvement in an AI startup, a decision based on InstaDeep’s founders selling a global vision to the Pan-African private equity firm. “InstaDeep happened to be quite different from other companies in our pipeline as they were actually into deep tech versus applying technology to a certain sector, where basically, you become an operator in that sector. They were developing specific technology that could impact many sectors,” noted Jilani on InstaDeep’s pioneering tech. “And it was also interesting, especially in Africa, where such companies are quite rare. And so when we had discussions with Karim over his vision and strategy, we quickly realized that InstaDeep could transform from an African leader in AI to a global player.” InstaDeep utilizes advanced machine learning techniques, including deep reinforcement learning in applications within an enterprise environment that cuts across various industries such as biotech, transportation, electronics manufacturing and logistics. Ultimately, this helps companies optimize the decision-making process and improve efficiency. Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim founded the startup in Tunis in 2014 with “two laptops, $2,000, and a lot of enthusiasm,” CEO Beguir told TechCrunch last year. The bootstrapped company — which didn’t receive outside capital until 2018 — depended on original AI research that Beguir published, which led to the startup being discovered by specialized clients who later became partners and investors, such as DeepMind, Google and its future acquirer BioNTech. As InstaDeep’s clientele grew globally, so did its team. The company has 240 staff across Tunis, London, Lagos, Dubai, Berlin, Cape Town, Paris, Boston and San Francisco. Also, InstaDeep’s ambition to become a global company made it move its headquarters from Tunis to London, which some publications have referenced as its home, thus neglecting its African roots. “InstaDeep is a global company, but in terms of origins and like the company’s early days, there’s no doubt that we’re African,” Beguir told me on the call. “One of the reasons we founded InstaDeep was to show that there was real potential and opportunity for AI in Africa. So we want people to see us as a deep tech African startup gone global, which sends a powerful message of hope for the space.” If anything, InstaDeep has proven that an African company with African talent can successfully serve clients globally while building a talent bridge corresponding to that growth. On the other side of the table are somewhat naive views that argue InstaDeep’s “Africanity.” Tunisia, due to its inhibiting government policies, is an unfriendly place to operate any startup or access venture capital — excluding InstaDeep, Tunisian startups raised $17 million last year, according to a report by VC firm Partech. As such, most startups have had to domicile abroad to access funding. Also, InstaDeep’s influence in building AI talent on the continent isn’t discussed enough. Last year, the upstart played a notable role in helping to organize and nurture Africa’s AI ecosystem via Deep Learning Indaba and AI Hack, hackathons and events with thousands of AI talents and 400 researchers in attendance. Most importantly, an African startup serving clients outside the continent doesn’t make it less African; in fact, founders should be encouraged to build software and AI businesses that present better exit opportunities than e-commerce, logistics and payments, sectors that international companies only consider when expanding into a new region. Image Credits: Tech Safari Image Credits: Tech Safari The ripple effect of InstaDeep building global-first is that it has put the Tunisian tech ecosystem and, more broadly, the AI industry in Africa under the radar with the news of its acquisition. Yet, it’s too early to assume that because of that, it’ll suddenly open the sluice of venture capital in Tunisian tech or Africa’s AI market, which currently lags several industries as hotbeds of investments on the continent. There is potential, though, particularly with the applications of the technology in various sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing; startups like South Africa’s Aerobotics and DataProphet have raised significant funding for this — however, patience will be required before any breathtaking activity occurs. To my question on whether InstaDeep is an outlier, Begiur expressed optimism that more success stories from Africa’s deep tech and AI community would be told sooner rather than later, especially as the venture capital market has turned red-hot for AI-based innovation. When this happens, the CEO says he hopes that founders and investors reinvest back into the space, something InstaDeep and AfricInvest intend to act on moving forward. “I believe that AI is a huge opportunity for Africa and I’ve been vocal about it. We often see AI as a technology and a competition between developed countries. In reality, AI is essential for Africa’s success in the 21st century, and the reason is that it is the transformational technology of our time; I think you’ll see so many examples these days from GPT and beyond of its disruptive potential,” Beguir, who is half-Tunisian and half-French continued. “But importantly, the barrier to entry to AI is much lower than, let’s say, technologies of the past that were classically associated with legacy companies and strong superpowers. As such, it is a great opportunity for the continent.” Last January, InstaDeep raised $100 million in Series B, over 12x what it raised in its previous priced round. Such was the proactive interest of new investors, including Alpha Intelligence Capital, CDIB, Google and BioNTech, its new owner with whom it started working with in 2019 and launched a joint AI innovation lab the following year to deploy the latest advances in AI and ML to develop novel medicines for a range of cancers and infectious diseases. Following the investment, InstaDeep was looking to make some acquisitions to ramp up its data collection capabilities to complement its AI systems before BioNTech swooped in with the acquisition offer, virtually leaving most of the growth financing untouched. “That was crazy. Frankly, we [InstaDeep and early investors like AfricInvest] did not expect that to happen,” expressed Ben Jilani, whose firm may be sitting on a conservative 10x+ exit multiple based on independent calculations. InstaDeep exited at a higher valuation than what it commanded for its Series B, according to Beguir. BioNTech acquires Tunisian-born and UK-based AI startup InstaDeep for £562M  According to a statement on the acquisition, BioNTech and InstaDeep have already developed multiple end-to-end AI-based applications trained on public and proprietary datasets across various scientific domains. These include projects to enhance neoantigen selection, ribological sequence optimization for BioNTech’s platforms, and the development of an Early Warning System to detect and monitor high-risk SARS-CoV-2 variants based on their ability to escape immune defenses announced last January. “With BioNTech, we have developed a partnership over the years and completed many successful projects together. We see great opportunities to build the next generation of immunotherapies and become the leader in biopharma and AI. I believe this is an exciting time, and we will have more to share in coming months,” Beguir said about the acquisition without divulging new information while adding that InstaDeep will use its Series B funding and exit money to scale its teams and capabilities across Africa and globally. “It’s a continuation of what we’ve done in many ways,” he added.","Germany’s largest vaccine maker BioNTech announced that it had agreed to acquire Tunisian-born and London-headquartered AI startup InstaDeep for up to £562 million. When completed (at $682 million, adjusted in U.S. dollar terms), it’ll become the largest acquisition deal involving an African or Africa-focused startup."
"African product, global market: Expensya employees cashed out $10M from 2023 acquisition",https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/13/african-product-global-market-expensya-employees-cashed-out-10m-from-2023-acquisition/,"What’s more rewarding for an angel investor than paper returns in a startup? An acquisition that turns those paper returns into a cash payout while still maintaining shares in the company. “The return after dilution was eight times my investment,” said Selma Ribica in an interview with TechCrunch recently. “I kept some stock of the new entity, but a big majority was cash.” Ribica currently serves as the general partner at First Circle Capital, a venture capital firm specializing in fintech SaaS, or fintech 2.0 as she terms it. She made her angel investment in Expensya, an expense management startup based in Tunis and Paris, which was acquired last June by the private equity firm Medius for a sum over $100 million, according to sources familiar with the deal. Only a few African or Africa-focused tech companies have been acquired for more than that amount: InstaDeep to BioNTech, Sendwave to WorldRemit, DPO Group to Network International and Paystack to Stripe. Like InstaDeep, the acquisition of Expensya underscores the potential of Africa-founded products to serve global markets and subsequently get bought by larger companies. For years, venture capital globally experienced a bullish trend, and Africa, albeit late to the party, caught on before things went south for the asset class in the latter half of 2022. Before the bust, local investors mainly encouraged African startups to focus on building solutions for the continent, with the promise that capital would follow. Building global products was often an afterthought, particularly as local solutions, especially fintechs, demonstrated exit opportunities by just targeting markets within the continent. However, there has been a notable shift in this narrative in the last 18 months. As African startups strive to develop solutions for local challenges, they now confront headwinds and macroeconomic challenges beyond their control. The economies of the continent’s most prominent tech markets — Nigeria, Kenya and Egypt — are currently grappling with currency devaluation issues, resulting in stagnant or slower revenue growth in dollar terms for startups operating in these markets, thereby diminishing their valuations in the eyes of global investors.  Last year was a tough period for African growth-stage startups and 2024 presents a mixed bag  In response, investors are now urging startups to explore strategies to safeguard their revenues, reigniting discussions about the importance of local founders adopting a global mindset when developing their products. That mindset was integral from the beginning for founders like Karim Jouini, founder and chief executive officer of Expensya.  “Adopting a global focus was almost from day one for many reasons. Regardless of what you are building as a company, Tunisia is a pretty small market that isn’t integrated enough with its neighbors,” said Jouini in an interview with TechCrunch. “It’s a country with an average income level and with companies that aren’t necessarily mature enough to be interested in spend management. Their companies are still setting up the first CRM or ERP. So from the beginning, we looked at building a product that is for markets where companies are mature and are at the stage where they are looking at employee productivity and spend management.” Founded by Jouini and CTO Jihed Othmani in 2014, Expensya specializes in automated expense management solutions tailored for European businesses. Its software enables companies to implement autonomous spending within predefined rules and limits, optimizing time and simplifying employee expense processes. When integrated with ERP applications, Expensya helps finance teams to oversee and track business expenditures and facilitate streamlined staff reimbursement procedures. The spend management startup, designed to support companies of all sizes in automating their professional expenses, was launched first in France, leveraging the CEO’s network and decade-plus experience working for Parrot, Musiwave and Microsoft. Expensya’s first set of clientele, which had between 1,000 and 10,000 employees, operated across multiple European countries — as a result, the startup quickly adapted its product to function in these other countries, handling local taxes and certifications along the way, which catalyzed its movement into Spain and Germany.  And despite the seeming advantage of proximity to Europe, being a Tunisian startup posed its challenges. First, navigating the European market reasonably protected from external competition due to laws like GDPR was a significant obstacle. Compliance with GDPR necessitated setting up operations in Europe and establishing strong local teams in sales and marketing was crucial for the startup to sell to large companies; it set up teams in France, Spain and Germany to address this requirement and compete against Concur, Nautilus and N2F.  “Sometimes, there was a bit of hesitation from these large customers when using a product built by an African startup. To them, they wanted to know if our quality was enough for them or as good as American or European products,” added Jouini. “So we invested a lot into having the best product in town. If you look at public ratings of solutions like ours on the App Store or Google Play, you will see that we are the highest rated in the market compared to our European competition because we focus on making sure that quality is never a topic because that would take us back to you’re an African startup and so standards could be lower.”  Setting and maintaining a high-quality product often hinges on a startup’s talent base. While there’s a wealth of young, talented individuals, particularly in engineering and other technical fields in Tunisia and Africa, the scarcity of experienced managers and leaders, also owing to a lack of successful SaaS companies locally, posed a hurdle as Expensya scaled, Jouini acknowledged. Generally, emigration has further reduced the availability of experienced talent in Africa, with many skilled individuals opting to pursue opportunities in Europe or the U.S. These factors contribute to the challenge of African startups competing with their global counterparts. However, talent positioning is a double-edged sword. Despite the talent shortage, Expensya benefited from lower operational expenses than similar companies operating in Europe. Additionally, if startups in Paris struggled to attract the top 5% due to stiff competition from tech giants like Google and Microsoft in their regions, Expensya could attract the top 5% talent in Tunisia because of its visibility as one of the country’s well-funded and resourced startups.  Jouini also emphasizes that while the Tunis-born but Paris-headquartered Expensya was perceived as just another SaaS company among many in Europe, its employees and early investors believed they contributed to something unique in Africa and maintained a bullish outlook on its potential. “When our employees join and spend time here, they have an engagement beyond salary and the job. It’s the feeling of building something big, which is actually a real difference,” he said. “It’s a sentiment that perhaps isn’t talked about enough — the eagerness of people in Africa, or at least in the countries I’m familiar with, to contribute to a global success story.” Last year, that shared optimism between investors and employees turned into a reality.  After operating for over eight years and raising about $30 million, including a $20 million Series B at a post-money valuation of over $50 million, per sources, Expensya got acquired — and its employees became part of an experience that remains elusive for many of their counterparts in the African tech ecosystem. Of the company’s 190 employees at the time of the acquisition, 110 were based in Tunisia. These employees, including previous staff who had worked out of Expensya’s Tunis office, totaling 180 shareholders, collectively made $10 million from the acquisition, as disclosed by Jouini during the call. He mentioned that two-thirds of this amount was in cash. “Some people made as much as $200,000-$250,000. It’s not exactly life-changing money, but it’s certainly path-changing,” Jouini, who now serves as the chief of product and tech at Medius, remarked about the employees’ cashouts. Medius, the Swedish conglomerate backed by prominent European private equity firms, has for years aimed to establish a global CFO automation conglomerate, making several acquisitions, including Expensya, in the U.K., U.S. and Sweden. Integrating these solutions creates a more cohesive and robust offering for Medius. Geographically, it also gives the private equity firm and its subsidiaries a more extensive reach across Europe and North America, even as Expensya, for instance, continues to operate independently. Before its acquisition, Expensya said it had doubled its recurring revenue within the two prior years and grown its customer base to 6,000 businesses and 700,000 active individual users spread across 100 countries.  Acquisition events like Expensya and Instadeep are noteworthy as they showcase that African startups can complete a full cycle, benefiting not just business angels (some made a 20x return, for instance) and VCs but also employees. While the scale is far off that of Silicon Valley or more mature tech ecosystems, it represents a positive step forward. These stakeholders will likely invest in startups or even launch their own ventures, contributing to the growth of Africa’s tech ecosystem.   “Expensya was built very efficiently. When you look at their return on capital, revenue-to-investment ratio and employee count, it’s a super-efficient structure that managed to scale to double-digit millions in revenues while keeping a modest valuation compared to similar models in Europe,” said Ribica, the former M-Pesa executive who has made investments in fintechs such as Qonto and Bamboo. “We should encourage more African startups to build and compete globally and create well-paying jobs at home where there is plenty of local engineering talent so they don’t leave their home countries for jobs in Europe and the U.S. This is the vision.” For enterprise products like Expensya, growing locally can be more challenging than expanding internationally due to less market maturity and slower decision-making. Jouini advises founders to focus on selling their products and make tweaks as soon as possible. “Don’t spend too much time overengineering it,” he says. “Selling and closing customers, and learning from them, is how you make your SaaS product local or global.” Secondly, Jouini and Ribica urge founders to prioritize talent and simultaneously hire for the present and the future while sharing equity along the way and making them feel part of a journey. “Stage one: build the product; stage two: launch the product with a couple of customers, tweak it, improve it, build a Unique Selling Proposition (USP); stage three: build, recruit, retain, that’s how you establish an enterprise sales machine, then you scale,” Ribica remarked. InstaDeep’s acquisition is a classic case of an African startup gone global  ","Expensya, an expense management startup based in Tunis and Paris, was acquired last June by the private equity firm Medius for a sum over $100 million.

"Tunisian enterprise AI startup InstaDeep raises $100M from AI Capital, BioNTech, Google",https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/25/tunisian-enterprise-ai-startup-instadeep-raises-100m-from-alpha-biontech-google/,"A recent survey carried out by CNBC reported that 81% of executives worldwide say AI will play a prominent and critical role in how their businesses operate this year. Companies are phasing from the first generation of AI, which deals with pattern, text and image recognition, to decision-making AI, which helps them make timely decisions in complex spaces. InstaDeep, a Tunis and London-based enterprise AI startup that creates decision-making systems for solving real-world problems, has raised $100 million in Series B financing led by Alpha Intelligence Capital and CDIB. BioNTech (the company behind Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine), Chimera Abu Dhabi, Deutsche Bahn’s DB Digital Ventures, Google, G42 and Synergie participated in the round. InstaDeep was founded by Karim Beguir and Zohra Slim in 2014. The Tunisian startup, headquartered in London with offices in Paris, Tunis, Lagos, Dubai and Cape Town, uses advanced machine learning techniques to bring AI to applications within an enterprise environment. Beguir, the chief executive officer, on a call with TechCrunch, said the eight-year-old company’s AI and machine learning solves an array of challenges. They can range from a large shipping company finding ways to efficiently transport thousands of containers to a railway station, with more than 30,000 kilometres of railway, trying to automate scheduling for 10,000 trains. Other examples are the design of advanced therapeutics with silicon and routing components on a printed circuit board. These types of problems, though in different verticals, have similarities. InstaDeep uses reinforcement learning, a kind of machine learning that helps design optimization strategies and tackles them simultaneously. In a statement, the company said it is currently working on a moonshot product to automate railway scheduling with Deutsche Bahn. The rail operator is the largest in Europe.  Two years ago, InstaDeep formed a multi-year strategic collaboration with BioNTech to launch a joint AI innovation lab. The lab’s mandate was to deploy the latest advances in AI and ML to develop novel immunotherapies. One of its best efforts came in late November when it created an early warning system (EWS) for detecting high-risk SARS-CoV-2 variants. Per a report by FT, this EWS identified more than 90% of World Health Organization (WHO) designated variants on average two months ahead of time and detected Omicron three days before it was classified as a variant of concern by the WHO. InstaDeep also collaborates with Google’s AI research divisions to create an early detection system for desert locust outbreaks in Africa; it has worked on AI initiatives and has published joint research with DeepMind and Google Research. A common theme with these partnerships is that all three organizations are investors in InstaDeep’s new financing round. “With them being our partners and customers, they’ve been able to see firsthand what InstaDeep platform and the team can achieve,” said Beguir. “So we see it as a significant milestone and also sort of a vote of confidence in our capabilities and products that they are investing having worked very closely with us on difficult problems for years.” Karim Beguir (InstaDeep CEO) Karim Beguir (InstaDeep CEO) Beguir and Slim bootstrapped InstaDeep from 2014 to 2018, pumping revenue from clients back into the business acquiring new talent and expanding. In 2019, the Tunisian startup raised a $7 million Series A round from pan-African private equity firm AfricInvest and New York-based Endeavor Catalyst to scale its systems. InstaDeep has established itself as a global company using AI to solve complex problems with significant monetary value. For example, building one kilometre of railway costs hundreds of millions of dollars. So, providing an intelligent system — which is one of InstaDeep’s applications — that can optimize train traffic, and manage constraints better, is highly marketable. With the new funding, the enterprise AI company plans to accelerate the launch of disruptive AI products across biotech, logistics, transportation and electronics manufacturing. Advancing its computing infrastructure, expanding into the U.S. and hiring more talent is also in its use of funds strategy.   InstaDeep currently has over 170 employees. More than 130 are in AI research, engineering, ML and DevOps departments, while half of the team is based in its African offices: South Africa, Nigeria and Tunisia. When InstaDeep launched, Africa wasn’t in the picture detailing AI’s contribution to global economic growth. And while that picture hasn’t changed so much, InstaDeep is one of the few African companies, including South Africa’s Aerobotics and hearX Group, trying to change that status quo and give Africa have a say in shaping the future of AI. “We’ve managed to build a culture of high standards and prove that the talents in Africa are capable of being competitive, working and collaborating with the very best,” said Beguir. “That’s the story we’ve been able to nurture. And today, we’re proud to have a team which is now over multiple countries in Europe, Middle East and Africa, but has some very passionate African AI researchers, engineers making a tangible contribution.” Beguir mentioned on the call that at the time InstaDeep started with “two laptops, $2,000 and a lot of enthusiasm,” many investors and onlookers within the African tech and AI space doubted the company’s goal to collaborate with the likes of DeepMind and Google. But if technology has taught us anything, location doesn’t pose a barrier in getting global customers. And this holds more true for AI and deep tech technology as long as companies have access to knowledge, talent with experience and an open AI community. Beguir, half Tunisian and half French, grew up in the North African country but studied engineering and mathematics in France and the U.S. After a classical career background, Beguir said he started InstaDeep to prove that African talent could be competitive, make a difference in deep tech and collaborate and compete with the best in the world. “It is possible to create a globally competitive company with strong African roots, but also well integrated into the world working on genuine deep-tech innovation, and doing things that haven’t been done before,” the CEO said. “That’s been our story so far, and we can’t wait to take it to the next level with our investors and partners and try to have a positive impact on the ecosystems in which we operate and all the partners with whom we work.”","InstaDeep, a Tunis and London-based enterprise AI startup, has raised $100 million in Series B financing.

How African startups raised funding in 2023,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/23/2023-vc-funding-in-africa/,"After defying the global funding slowdown of 2022, VC investments in African startups dropped considerably last year, mirroring the situation in other regions where capital taps were significantly turned off. The drop, however, was not unexpected as months preceding the year, deals had become infrequent as investors began to pull away. Data trackers set the amount raised by African startups in 2023 at between $2.9 billion and $4.1 billion, from $4.6 billion to $6.5 billion in total funding the previous year. With equity funding becoming rare, several startups found it hard to survive, leading them to either cut down their teams or scale down operations and, in some cases, close shop. Others settled for down-and-bridge rounds, with many triggered to reevaluate their strategies for sustainability. Last year was a tough period for African growth-stage startups and 2024 presents a mixed bag  Yet it wasn’t all bad news; data shows that investors diversified their risks with more funding and deals in other regions like Francophone Africa, exploring beyond the traditional top four African VC markets — Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa. These four countries took a massive funding hit in 2023. “In this dry market, the African tech ecosystem paid much more attention to Francophone Africa growing its share of transaction and funding,” said Tidjane Deme, general partner at Partech Africa. “The steady growth of this region over the last years is explained by the ability of local investors — who drive more and more of the ecosystem — to expand beyond the top markets visible to global investors. They see the untapped opportunity in Francophone countries.” Also, while fintech sustained its top position as the most funded sector, there was continued sectoral diversification with startups in spheres such as climate tech, commerce, health, and biotech, capturing investor interest. Other significant events in the African startup ecosystem included a fintech unicorn from Egypt and the acquisition of InstaDeep, a Tunis-born and U.K.-based artificial intelligence (AI) startup, by German-based biotech company BioNTech SE. Below, we explore notable figures and trends from 2023 as per findings from data trackers Briter Bridges, Partech, and The Big Deal compared to 2022. Partech: Total VC funding in Africa stood at $3.5 billion, a 46% drop from 2022. Equity investment into African startups dropped by 54% to $2.3 billion, while debt funding saw a year-on-year drop of 22% to $1.2 billion. The report notes a marginal growth in the number of debt deals as it became an alternative source of capital for many venture-backed businesses last year, with equity deal count dropping by 32%. Briter Bridges: The 2023 deal volume was $4.1 billion, a 21% drop from the previous year, according to Briter’s data, which includes debt, equity, and acquisitions. Notably, while there was a funding slowdown, the firm maintains that the number of deals grew by 11% to 1,080 owing to more activity happening at the early stage, especially from accelerator programs in Africa taking in large cohorts and venture studios. The Big Deal: The team says the total funding raised in Africa last year was $2.9 billion, a 39% drop from the previous period. This figure considers all types of funding raised, including debt, equity, and grants. According to the firm, equity funding dropped by 57% to $1.7 billion, while debt grew by 47% to $1.1 billion. For many years startups were complaining about the fact that there was not enough venture debt available and it looks like things are changing, and it’s definitely and encouraging trend. — Big Deal co-founder Maxime Bayen. Partech: South Africa ($548 million), Nigeria ($468 million), Egypt ($433 million), and Kenya ($335 million) dominate the market, per Partech, reclaiming a growing share for the first time since 2019. These countries remain the key hubs for investment, securing 79% of the total equity funding volume (compared to 72% in 2022) despite a slight decline in deal count, accounting for 68% of all deals (down from 77% in 2022). Briter Bridges: The top four markets — Kenya, Egypt, Nigeria, and South Africa — further strengthened their positions as leading funding destinations, collectively securing substantial investments of $806 million, $675 million, $575 million, and $565 million, respectively. This trend is reinforced by their role as regional hubs for companies expanding into neighboring countries, Briter noted.  The Big Deal: Kenya emerged as the Big Deal’s leading African VC investment destination, securing $800 million. Egypt follows closely in second place with $640 million, South Africa claims the third spot with $600 million, and Nigeria takes fourth place with $400 million. VCs set sights on African countries beyond the ‘Big Four’  Partech: French-speaking nations experienced increased representation, claiming five out of the remaining six spots in the top ten, including Morocco ($93 million), Democratic Republic of Congo ($42 million), Rwanda ($38 million), Tunisia ($33 million), and Senegal ($27 million). Meanwhile, Ghanaian startups secured $75 million in funding. The Big Deal: Rounding up the top 10 for the data tracker include the Benin Republic ($71 million), the Democratic Republic of Congo ($62 million), Ghana ($57 million), Senegal, and Rwanda at $44 million each, and Tanzania ($25 million). Briter Bridges: Countries like Tunisia ($460 million+) and Rwanda (350 million+) have become prominent hubs, rapidly approaching the funding levels of the “Big Four.” This surge is fueled by substantial investment and acquisition deals in companies like Zipline and InstaDeep. Briter also identifies emerging hotspots such as Benin Republic ($125 million+) and Ghana ($70 million). Investor region diversification is a sign of a maturing African marker. There are more investors entering the region with the mandate to invest in “riskier” regions. Investors are also aware of market opportunities and there’s money to be made there. — Briter Bridges founder Dario Giuliani. In the past year, new funds like Saviu and Seedstars Africa Ventures were established with a focus on startups in relatively untapped VC markets, particularly in Francophone Africa. How African startups raised venture capital in 2022  Partech: In 2023, there was a significant drop in the number of investors participating in funding rounds in Africa compared to the previous year, witnessing a 50% decrease. This decline was particularly notable among major institutional funds that typically led larger funding rounds. For example, Partech observed only one equity and three debt megadeals (i.e., above $100 million) in 2023, contrasting with seven equity and four debt megadeals in 2022. The Big Deal: In 2023, the data tracker noted a year-over-year drop of -38% in the number of unique investors, totaling 619+. This decline is consistent with the overall decrease in funding and the number of ventures raising $100,000 or more, both experiencing a -39% year-over-year reduction. What stands out for me is the 50% decrease in investor participation. It explains most of the rest of the data. And it has deep implication on the structure of the ecosystem in the near future. — Tidjane Deme, general partner at Partech Africa. Nothing new here. As in years past, fintech is once again recognized as the best-funded sector on the continent. The journey toward financial inclusion is unending. According to Partech, fintech startups secured $852 million, 37% of the total equity investment. Alternative reports by Briter Bridges and The Big Deal estimate fintech funding at $1 billion+ and $1.25 billion (41% of total equity funding), respectively.  Unsurprisingly, clean tech comes up second in the data trackers’ lists. Briter pegs the total amount raised by clean tech startups at over $800 million. Per The Big Deal, clean tech accounts for 28% of the funding raised. For Partech, though, the sector ties e-commerce for the second spot, claiming 13% each of the total funding African startups raised, with health tech and enterprise rounding up the top five.  Per The Big Deal, the following best-funded sectors are after fintech and clean tech, logistics and transport, health, and agriculture. For Briter, it’s health, software and mobility. Egyptian financial services provider MNT-Halan valued at $1B in $400M funding  New solar mini-grids in Africa to be powered by Husk Power Systems’ $103M Series D  According to Briter Bridges, substantial investment in female-led startups is a trend that has struggled to see significant change. “Despite marginal gains, funding into all female-founded companies remains a meager fraction of that going to male-founded companies. While deals into all female-founded companies are on the rise, the total dollar value raised by these companies is not showing radical increases,” it said.  Partech and The Big Deal are more explicit by showing numbers. For instance, per The Big Deal, startups with a solo female founder or an all-female founding team raised 2.3% of the total funding last year; meanwhile, 15% of the funding went to a founding team with at least one woman. (Last year, both figures stood at 2.4% and 13%, respectively.) Regarding deal count, female-founded startups raised $25% of the equity category in 2023, per Partech (22% in 2022). These startups secured $392 million, accounting for 17% of the total equity funding raised (13% in 2022) and 2% of debt funding, the firm, which didn’t provide data on only all-female founded teams, added.","VC investments in African startups dropped considerably last year. Data trackers set the amount raised by African startups in 2023 at between $2.9 billion and $4.1 billion. Equity funding dropped by 57% to $1.7 billion, while debt grew by 47%. Fintech sustained its top position as the most funded sector."
"Deel acquires Africa’s PaySpace, says it’s crossed $500M in ARR",https://techcrunch.com/2024/03/05/deel-acquires-payspace-500m-arr/,"Deel is on an acquisition march. On Tuesday, the HR startup announced it is acquiring African-based payroll and HR software and services company PaySpace in a deal that marks its largest acquisition to date. The move comes less than one week after Deel announced it had picked up Munich-based Zavvy, an AI-based “people development” startup building tools for personalized career progression, training and performance management. Financial terms of the PaySpace acquisition were not disclosed. Africa-based PaySpace boasts over 14,000 customers utilizing its software and services in 44 countries across Europe, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Customers include multinationals across various industries such as Heineken, Coca-Cola Beverages and Puma Sports SA. For Deel, a $12 billion HR startup facilitating talent hiring, payment, and management in over 70 countries, the acquisition offers an opportunity to strengthen its footprint in Africa. Although PaySpace secured undisclosed financing last year from Netcash, a payments solutions provider specializing in debit orders and salary payouts, it doesn’t fit the mold of a typical venture-backed startup and is very much a bootstrapping success story. Brothers Bruce, Clyde and Warren Clark, along with George Karageorgiades, founded PaySpace in 2007 as a cloud-based payroll and human resources platform aimed at streamlining the laborious payroll runs and backup procedures associated with traditional payroll and HR software prevalent at the time. Within three years of its inception, PaySpace expanded its product reach to 11 countries. By 2022, this footprint had extended to 43 countries. That year, the company’s executives announced plans to further expand into Brazil and the U.K. Sales of the 20-year-old company — whose clientele includes international and local blue-chip customers, ranging in size from one-person shops to enterprises with thousands of employees — have been growing by over 30% annually, according to managing director Sandra Crous in a recent interview with Financial Minds. Separately, San Francisco–based Deel also revealed Tuesday that it has crossed $500 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), organically, outside of this acquisition. That’s up from $290 million in ARR at the end of 2022. Deel also claims that it has been EBITDA positive since September 2022 and still has $600 million left in the bank. IPO plans are still a way off but likely to be in the 2025/2026 timeframe, Deel CEO and co-founder Alex Bouaziz told TechCrunch last week at the time of the Zavvy acquisition. The news also follows Deel’s acquisition of APAC payroll provider PayGroup. With the various buys, Deel claims that it now owns the full HR stack — entities, local teams (legal, HR payroll), and local payroll engines  — across six continents. PaySpace built 45 engines in the past 15 years, according to Bouaziz. Deel’s four-year ambition is to serve 100 countries with native payroll engines. “We were their customer, running payroll in 10 countries using PaySpace,” Bouaziz said. “Our internal team was dying to acquire them and have the ability to do on-the-spot calculations. Theirs is one of the best technologies we’ve ever seen . . . We had to do a lot of convincing.” In a written statement, PaySpace director Clyde van Wyk said: “Like PaySpace, Deel strives to evolve its offering through disruption. We set out to modernize the payroll industry, which was burdened by manual processes and stringent legislative and compliance requirements, much like Deel revolutionized global hiring.” Deel now owns over 150 entities globally and manages in-house, in-country payroll teams in over 70 countries, in addition to offering employer of record, contractor, immigration, HRIS, and performance management services. “One of the key things when you run payroll typically the way we have is in working with local software engine and tax calculations, you have to be integrated with the best payroll software,” Bouaziz said. “But there’s nothing like owning your own technology. We went from two engines to five engines, and now to more than 50 with the acquisition of PaySpace.” For its part, Deel is making a big push into the enterprise, something it believes PaySpace will also help with. Prior to the buy, Deel had 25,000 customers, including Klarna, Shopify and Hermès. Some of the clients may overlap, but the combination will effectively grow its customer count fairly significantly. Beyond specifics, the deal highlights a notable trend over the past 18 months: the third acquisition involving Africa-founded companies and global counterparts. Last January, German vaccine manufacturer BioNTech acquired the London-headquartered AI startup InstaDeep, which originated in Tunisia, for up to £562 million. In June, private equity firm Medius bought Expensya, an expense management startup headquartered in Tunis and Paris, for over $100 million, as per sources familiar with the transaction. Also in 2020, Stripe notably acquired Paystack, a startup out of Lagos, Nigeria, that, like Stripe, provided a quick way to integrate payments services into an online or offline transaction.

‘Mega-deals’ could be inflating overall AI funding figures,https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/05/mega-deals-ai-funding-q3/,"It’s safe to say that VCs struck while the iron was hot this year where it concerned generative AI. While venture capital investments overall fell compared to last year thanks to macroeconomic challenges and other related factors, startups in the generative AI space — and AI more broadly — did quite well. Funding for AI-related startups surpassed $68.7 billion in 2023, according to PitchBook, with generative AI vendors like OpenAI, Stability AI and Anthropic accounting for a substantial portion of that figure. And it appears that the sector will likely close the year with substantially higher investments than the past couple of years. But could the top-level numbers be misleading? A report on AI investment in Q3 by PitchBook, released Tuesday, found that “mega-deals” (i.e., multi-hundred-million-dollar investments from big-name backers) vastly inflated deal totals this year. For example, just a few months ago, Amazon pledged to invest up to $4 billion in Anthropic, the company developing the AI-powered chatbot Claude. OpenAI secured a $10 billion investment from Microsoft (albeit not all at once and partly in the form of cloud compute credits). Inflection AI, a firm creating what it describes as more “personal” AI assistants, raised $1.3 billion in a funding round led by Microsoft. The list goes on. In Q3, VC funding inclusive of mega-deals totaled around $22.1 billion. But after subtracting the tech-giant-led tranches secured by generative AI startups, the total is closer to $15.1 billion for the sector. That’s a big discrepancy, but it isn’t exactly unanticipated. Earlier this year, PitchBook reported that the number of VC deals involving generative AI companies declined 27% in Q3, while aggregate deal value increased by 39% to $6.1 billion, buoyed by massive investments from Big Tech companies. The aggregate value would’ve been lower, too, had Big Tech giants not thrown their hats in the ring. Could it be that VCs, initially swept up by the generative AI hype, are coming down to earth and/or growing wary of the tech’s risks? Perhaps. The case of Stability AI, the startup behind the open source image-generating model Stable Diffusion, is instructive. After raising more than $100 million in VC capital within the last 14 months, the company is now said to be positioning itself for an acquisition at the behest of its investors, including Coatue, which has grown concerned about its financial position. Running a cutting-edge AI venture is expensive, it turns out. Not only do data scientists command sky-high salaries, but the computing power necessary to train and run AI models is exceptionally costly. Case in point: One of Microsoft’s premiere AI products, the code-generating GitHub Copilot, has reportedly been losing the company up to $80 per user, per month due to model inferencing costs. And it costs OpenAI an estimated $700,000 a day to operate ChatGPT. Lawsuits over generative AI tech might be giving investors pause, too — especially those concerning IP disputes. Because of the way generative AI models are architected, they sometimes spit out mirror copies of the millions to billions of examples of text, images and so on that they’re trained on, and not all of those examples are in the public domain. Microsoft, GitHub and OpenAI are currently being sued in a class action lawsuit that accuses them of violating copyright law by allowing Copilot to regurgitate licensed code snippets without providing credit. Elsewhere, authors in California and New York have sued OpenAI for alleged IP theft of their works. A number of tech giants have promised to defend customers against copyright lawsuits implicating their generative AI technologies. But many startups, including Stability AI, haven’t, and likely won’t given the substantial legal expenses such protection would entail. Now, this isn’t to suggest it’s all doom and gloom in AI startup land. The PitchBook report out today suggests that exit activity is showing signs of recovery in 2023, with 108 AI exits so far worth a combined $9.1 billion. MosaicML, which Databricks acquired for $1.3 billion, and InstaDeep, bought by vaccine developer BioNTech for $680.9 million, were the biggest winners here by far. AI modernization via mergers and acquisitions appears to be a reviving source of AI exits, PitchBook says, adding that more “mega-exits” over $1 billion are expected next year. PitchBook also notes that all AI verticals, except for consumer AI and transportation, raised more than $1 billion for the time period the report tracked — a first since the broader VC funding downturn. Will the momentum endure? That’s the billion-dollar question. But PitchBook, for what it’s worth, asserts that the trend shows “health for late-stage funding in specific domains.”","Venture capital investments overall fell compared to last year.

Norrsken22’s debut fund closes at $205M to back growth-stage startups in Africa,https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/norrsken22s-debut-fund-closes-at-205m-to-back-growth-stage-startups-in-africa/,"It’s exciting times for growth-stage investment in Africa as Norrsken22, a Pan-African venture capital firm, achieves the final close of its debut fund, raising a total of $205 million, surpassing its initial target. This also highlights a keen interest from institutional investors in supporting African startups at an essential phase of their journey. Norrsken22, established by five individuals with extensive experience in venture capital and private equity, includes founding partners Niklas Adalberth and Hans Otterling, along with managing partner Natalie Kolbe and general partners Ngetha Waithaka and Lexi Novitske. This venture capital firm, nearly two years old, has operational teams in Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Ghana. The partners launched the fund, named the Norrsken22 African Tech Growth Fund, in January last year after reaching the first close at $110 million. Approximately 59% of the funding came from a consortium of 30 unicorn founders globally, including Flutterwave CEO Olugbenga Agboola, Skype co-founder Niklas Zennström, iZettle co-founder Jacob de Geer, and Delivery Hero co-founder Niklas Östberg. Norrsken22 began its fundraising at a time when there was a significant surge in capital flowing into the tech sector. In addition to discussions with several development finance institutions (DFIs) and family offices, a prerequisite for raising a large fund in Africa, the firm aimed to achieve the final close by the end of 2022. However, the global tech investment landscape has experienced a pullback since then, impacting fundraising efforts across the board, including from institutional investors. In 2022, venture capital activity in Africa reached $5 billion to $6 billion. So far, in 2023, it has dwindled to a range between $2.5 billion and $3.4 billion (based on data from The Big Deal and Briter Bridges), reflecting the decline in overall VC activity. Norrsken22 general partners. Image Credits: Norrsken22 Norrsken22 general partners. Image Credits: Norrsken22 The current slowdown in tech investments caused a year delay for Norrsken22 to achieve its final close. Nevertheless, this accomplishment is noteworthy considering the challenges many VC firms, both local and global, are still facing in raising or closing their funds. What’s even more impressive is that the growth fund was oversubscribed. Managing partner Kolbe attributes this success to a renewed fundraising momentum observed at the beginning of 2023. Additionally, the extensive experience of Norrsken22’s founding team in African investments, along with the backing of other limited partners, mainly founders of the unicorn startups, played a significant role in attracting interest and support for the fund, she remarked. After the initial close of the fund, which saw support from SEB Pension Foundation and a few family offices, Norrsken22 attracted the likes of British International Investment (BII), International Finance Corporation (IFC), U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Standard Bank and Norfund as new limited partners. Norrsken, VCs and 30 unicorn founders set up $200M fund to back growth-stage startups in Africa  International funds typically spearhead most large deals in Africa, while local investors primarily concentrate on pre-seed to Series A rounds with smaller to medium-sized funds. Large Africa-focused funds like Norrsken22 aim to bridge the gap from growth to late-stage investments. Approximately 50% of Norrsken’s capital will be allocated to building its portfolio with Series A and B companies; the remaining will be reserved for follow-on investments, primarily in the B and C rounds, according to Kolbe. In a statement, the firm said it is focused on “entrepreneurs developing fintech, edtech, medtech [health tech], and market-enabling solutions that will deliver strong returns and have a positive impact across Africa.” So far, the Pan-African growth-stage fund has made five investments, including challenger bank TymeBank, B2B commerce retail platform Sabi, identity verification solution Smile Identity, auto financing platform Autochek and financing app for informal merchant communities Shara. “The kind of value that we bring is for companies that are looking to grow beyond their borders and building up multi-country, Pan-African businesses. Having three general partners in the beacon economies of sub-Saharan Africa: Nigeria, Kenya and South Africa, we were able to provide the companies with people on the ground and networks on the ground, and we also understand the nuances of growth and opportunity in each of our markets,” Kolbe said on Norrsken22’s investment strategy. “Also, these are startups looking for an investor that can write a big check and can follow on in future rounds and anchor those rounds. That’s become very important, particularly now as liquidity becomes a bit tighter on the continent.” Norrsken22’s target remains investing in approximately 20 startups. The fund’s typical investment ticket size averages around $10 million. Yet, it may go as high as $16 million, encompassing follow-on rounds in select portfolio companies, as discussed by the partners in a previous interview. African B2B e-commerce startup Sabi tops $300M valuation in new funding  Like Norrsken22, several other growth-stage firms, including Partech Africa, TLcom Capital, Algebra Ventures, Sawari Ventures and Novastar Ventures, have raised one to two funds over the past couple of years to address the shortage of capital in Series A and beyond. However, some of them have also invested at the pre-seed and seed stages, a possibility that Norrsken22 may explore if the right opportunity arises. “We have put a small amount aside for the opportunistic earliest stage. If something comes to us and looks exciting, we may put small amounts of capital in, but that’s not where our focus is at all,” remarked Kolbe. Indeed, a key focus in the investment strategy of a growth stage fund is preparing portfolio companies for exits. According to the general partner, Norrsken22 thoroughly evaluates the potential exit scenarios, including working to identify potential buyers for its portfolio companies and assessing the valuations they might offer at the end of its investment period. This diligence is critical and the firm has declined investments where a compelling exit case was not evident, she added. The managing partner posits that the firm is looking at exits for its portfolio companies through international strategic buyers and consolidation involving local industry leaders. Large multinational corporations in Africa could also present exit opportunities to startups. Some of these companies often struggle to innovate in-house and may seek innovation by acquiring tech businesses, which can be integrated into their operations or kept as separate entities under a different brand. Norrsken22’s debut fund is supported by an advisory council of business leaders in multinationals across banking, telecommunications, agriculture and real estate. InstaDeep’s acquisition is a classic case of an African startup gone global  ","Norrsken22, a Pan-African venture capital firm, achieves the final close of its debut fund, raising a total of $205 million, surpassing its initial target.

Modus expands to sub-Saharan Africa with the launch of its AI and blockchain-focused $75M fund,https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/15/modus-expands-to-sub-saharan-africa-with-the-launch-of-its-ai-and-blockchain-focused-75m-fund/,"New York-based venture platform Modus has launched Modus Africa, a venture capital fund for AI and blockchain startups across sub-Saharan Africa, TechCrunch has learned. The fund is expected to reach its first close in the first quarter of next year. The spinoff continues Modus’s string of moves over the past 18 months, which has seen it add branches in Abu Dhabi, Cairo, and, most recently, Riyadh, supported by institutions like Mubadala’s Hub71. Modus says that its entry into Africa creates an “additional conduit of market access for Modus portfolio companies while also enabling African startups to scale into the MENA region.” As a “holistic venture platform,” Modus runs three business units focusing on entrepreneurs and startups in the MENA and GCC regions. They include the Venture Builder, which works with idea and early-stage MVP stage companies. Then there’s Corporate Innovation, a service platform that leverages the firm’s internal know-how to support corporations and government entities. And its Venture Capital arm provides investment to early and midstage-sized startups, such as staffing platform Ogram. On its website, Modus says its fund is backed by several investors ranging from UHNWI, family offices, private investors, and government-backed entities from the U.S., the EU, and MENA. Although Modus primarily invests in foreign-based companies that are “portable to the Middle East,” as well as startups in Egypt and the GCC, its expansion into sub-Saharan Africa isn’t surprising. Last year, African startups raised over $5 billion and minted five unicorns (per this report, the continent observed a 250% year-over-year growth in funding and surpassed capital deployed in MENA). And despite the current macroeconomic trends and conditions that have resulted in layoffs, down rounds and shutdowns, startups on the continent are set to top last year’s fundraising record numbers. Unlike other firms with marked funds interested in Africa, Modus’s interest in AI and blockchain technologies is intriguing. Though it has household names such as Tunisia’s InstaDeep, Kenya’s Sama, and South Africa’s DataProphet — and several web3 startups claiming to build on the blockchain — Africa’s AI and blockchain sectors are still relatively nascent. The thinking behind adopting this strategy can be traced to Vianney Mathonnet and Andre Jr. Ayotte, the general partners of Modus’s Africa-focused fund. Both partners, in an interview with TechCrunch, described how several stints working in banking, finance and Dubai-based family offices pointed them to the emergence of blockchain technology and its outsized opportunity and application in Africa. “Not long after we launched this project after noticing how massive blockchain and AI could be in Africa, we were approached by Modus Capital because they wanted a Pan-African strategy themselves,” said Ayotte. “They were looking for people with the know-how, the network, experience to do that, so we started discussing how the partnership would work. Ultimately, what happened is that our project became the Modus Africa fund.” L-R: Andre Jr. Ayotte and Vianney Mathonnet (General Partners, Modus Africa) L-R: Andre Jr. Ayotte and Vianney Mathonnet (General Partners, Modus Africa) According to a statement, Modus says Africa has the potential of reaching 200 million+ new blockchain users in the next four years, fueled by necessity and a fast-growing tech-savvy population. Nevertheless, the six-year-old VC firm isn’t only taking a chance on purely AI and blockchain startups; instead, it is cutting checks in startups across broader sectors that are implementing those technologies into their products. The firm is currently closing three investments in startups using AI and blockchain across insurtech, fintech and health tech, said the general partners who control the fund’s thesis, direction and investment strategy while leveraging Modus’s 50+ team to carry out due diligence and portfolio management. Mathonnet said the “jurisdiction-agnostic” Modus Africa will invest in about 45 seed-stage startups and allocate 50% of the $75 million SDG-focused fund for follow-on investments, especially in Series A rounds. These checks will range from $350,000 to $1.2 million across both stages. “We as a fund will reinvest in our winners and our LPs are also looking to reinvest in them outside the fund, catalyzing even more money in the ecosystem in Africa,” said the partners. “In terms of countries, we know that tech talent and incubators are really strong in tech ecosystems like Kenya and Nigeria, Egypt, and South Africa, and it’s inevitable that a good deal flow within all these regions. With that said, though, we are exploring new regions and searching for key partnerships to enter those markets and add some support and sustainability for deal flow.” Some of these markets include the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Niger and others in Francophone Africa. Speaking on the formation of Modus Africa, Kareem Elsirafy, the managing partner of Modus, said in a statement: “Modus is proud to be launching an Africa-MENA investment corridor to continue supporting and investing in emerging innovation ecosystems. The Modus platform is uniquely positioned to deliver impact and value to African communities through operational, institutional, and financial capital. We’re excited to have Vianney and Andre leading the way on this journey.”","New York-based venture platform Modus has launched Modus Africa, a venture capital fund for AI and blockchain startups across sub-Saharan Africa.

 Some sources told Manish that OpenAI’s startup fund is in talks to invest in silicon chip bigwigs Sam Zeloof and Jim Keller, who started Atomic Semi to manufacture chips. And get this: the proposed $15 million investment will value the company at $100 million. Not too shabby, er, should we say silicon-y. And we have five more for you:","German-based biotech company BioNTech is set to acquire InstaDeep, a Tunis-born and U.K.-based AI startup for up to £562 million (~$680 million) in its largest deal yet. Supermom, a parenting platform with 20 million users in six Southeast Asian countries, offers parents price comparisons, communities and the chance to earn money by completing surveys."
Pan-African contrarian investor P1 Ventures reaches $25M first close for its second fund,https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/26/pan-african-contrarian-investor-p1-ventures-reaches-25m-first-close-for-its-second-fund/,"Pan-African venture capital firm P1 Ventures has reached the first close of its second fund at $25 million. The venture capital firm secured this capital from some of Africa’s largest industrial conglomerates and private companies, several fund of funds and general partners of global funds based in the U.S. and Europe. P1 Ventures expects to reach a final close by early next year, founder and general partner Mikael Hajjar told TechCrunch in an interview. Hajjar launched P1 Ventures in 2020 with Hisham Halbouny, who also serves as a general partner. Its first fund (a proof of concept fund, as Hajjar calls it) allocated $11 million to 24 ventures, primarily concentrating on e-commerce, fintech, insurtech, health tech, and SaaS industries. While this second fund (its first institutional fund) will still focus on these sectors, the firm is adding AI to the mix. Its first investment in this category is Zambian startup Nkoloso.ai, which gathers data and keeps track of vast tracts of agricultural land using satellite imagery and AI. It’s also one of two AI startups and five portfolio companies the Dubai–based venture capital firm has backed from its second fund. Hajjar argues that the use of AI by the firm in the agriculture and fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) sectors exemplifies Africa’s potential to leverage this emerging technology to bypass traditional infrastructure, similar to the way mobile money in Africa surpassed the need for debit and credit card infra. Additionally, AI demonstrates how African companies may develop products with global reach. “We believe that AI will be Africa’s next big leapfrog opportunity. So when you think how fintech transformed the continent and allowed it to disrupt the banking sector, we believe AI will do the same with sectors like retail, healthcare, and the creative economy,” said the general partner. “What we see beautiful in AI is the ability to export. As you know, single market and currency risk are the main risks in investing in Africa. The beauty of AI is that you have export-first businesses.” Hajjar cited Egypt-born Instabug and BioNTech-subsidiary InstaDeep as examples of such African-founded software and AI businesses with customers in the U.S., Europe and globally. P1 Ventures, which has offices in Lagos and Cairo, recently began an Entrepreneur In Residence program, under which Nkoloso.ai received funding. Both partners utilize their skills and expertise as past operators to manage this venture studio, which plans to incubate four more startups in the next four years headed by founders capable of achieving product-market fit and scaling the product. During the interview, Hajjar proudly highlights his firm’s “contrarian” approach to VC investment in Africa. “We go off the beaten path and back the underdogs; we invest where no one else does,” he says, underscoring super early investments made from P1 Ventures’ first fund in startups operating within Francophone Africa markets, including Yassir, a mobility startup-turned-super app in Algeria; Chari, a B2B e-commerce platform in Morocco; and Djamo, a payments startup in the Ivory Coast. These upstarts have emerged as the most well-funded startups in their respective countries. Notably, Yassir, the firm’s first investment, stands out as one of the most valuable startups in Africa and the Middle East. L-R: Hisham Halbouny and Mikael Hajjar.

Image Credits: P1 Ventures Although most of P1 Ventures’ investments from its initial fund were made in the seed stage, the firm characterizes itself as multistage and occasionally engages in Series A and B investments opportunistically. It is evident that P1 Ventures likely provided small checks during subsequent stages of expansion for companies such as Yassir and Egyptian fintech MoneyFellows, owing to the limited size of its first capital. Nevertheless, it is intriguing that the firm was able to participate in these rounds. Hajjar explained that the partners’ institutional track record plays a significant factor. He also noted specific instances when stage and geographical arbitrage were crucial and emphasized their active involvement in assisting companies with investors for follow-on rounds, talent, and expansion strategy. “Very few African GPs manage funds with that institutional track record and that allows us to have better visibility on what it takes to build category-defining businesses, especially as we look at inflection points and arbitrage across stages and geographies,” the general partner said, referencing how P1 Ventures picked Chari at the pre-seed stage rather than more popular B2B e-commerce deals in Egypt and Nigeria and MoneyFellows at Series A instead of other pre-seed/seed stage fintechs at comparable price points in Egypt. On top of that, P1 Ventures was also instrumental in connecting MoneyFellows with CommerzVentures for its Series B round and Chari in several acquisitions it has made in the last two years, Hajjar remarked. Yassir pulls in $150M for its super app, led by Bond  Gameball, an Egyptian software company gamifying loyalty and customer retention with a client base across 70 countries, and General Atlantic-backed healthtech Reliance Health are among P1 Ventures’ 29 early-stage investments in 10 countries since its launch. P1 Ventures has observed that, on average, its portfolio businesses have secured 35 times more follow-on money for every dollar it has invested, even in the face of a decline in global venture capital funding. The firm, which didn’t disclose its IRR, asserts that the metric stems from the significant value it contributes to its portfolio firms beyond capital. This value is primarily attributed to the partners’ multistage, multisector expertise and extensive networks across the U.S., Europe, and Asia. “I’m the first Mauritanian to launch a fund; as you can appreciate, this comes with a deep sense of meaning. I know African talent is more dispersed than current VC is. I intend to be this change agent and empower the next generation of African entrepreneurs. Just like people took a chance on me as an emerging fund manager, it’s my duty now to back underdog founders and turn them into regional, if not global, winners,” Hajjar stated. “Also, what Africa is going through right now, we believe, is very similar to what Europe went through 25 years ago or what Latin America went through eight years ago. We believe P1 is best positioned to emerge as the premier VC just like Index Ventures did in Europe or Kaszek in Latin America.” Before engaging in angel investing in 2014 and establishing P1 Ventures in 2021, Halbouny previously had a position as a partner at Man Capital, a subsidiary of Mansour Group. Man Capital had invested early in prominent companies such as Uber, Airbnb, and Bolt. He was also managing director at EFG Hermes, one of MENA’s largest investment banks. On the other hand, Hajjar, a Stanford MBA graduate and engineer, held roles in Google, Zum, and Areva. Along with the partners, P1’s advisory group also consists of investors and operators, including Emil Michael, the former chief business officer of Uber, and Bernard Dalle, a founding team member of London-based Index Ventures. “Innovation across the African continent is booming and P1 is ideally positioned to help African entrepreneurs at the earliest stages build valuable and enduring businesses,” Dalle noted. ",Pan-African venture capital firm P1 Ventures has reached the first close of its second fund at $25 million. The firm secured this capital from some of Africa’s largest industrial conglomerates and private companies. Its first fund (a proof of concept fund) allocated $11 million to 24 ventures.
VCs set sights on African countries beyond the ‘Big Four’,https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/15/vcs-set-sights-on-african-countries-beyond-the-big-four/,"Africa’s tech startup scene has grown significantly over the last decade, with various reports showing a sizable increase in the number of deals, ticket sizes and funding. Last year, startups in the continent raised about $5 billion, double what was raised in 2021 and nine times the amount from five years ago. However, this growth has been focused on four countries — Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa and Egypt, known as the “Big Four” because they account for more than 70% of venture capital investment into the continent. But VCs are shifting their attention elsewhere, reaching startups in at least 29 countries last year, up from 26 in 2020 and 19 the previous year. Outside the Big Four, investments ballooned to $1.4 billion, up 382% year on year, according to Partech’s 2021 report. What could be driving the sudden interest in other African countries? “Investors are looking for better-priced but quality deals in these markets. Deals in the Big Four have become overpriced and competitive with the entry of foreign investors,” Abel Boreto, the associate investment director of Nairobi-based Novastar Ventures, told TechCrunch.  Outside the Big Four, Novastar has invested in SolarNow from Uganda, an East African country that has also experienced a rise in investor interest; as well as weather forecast startup Ignitia and health tech scaleup mPharma, both from Ghana, which typically lands just behind the Big Four in terms of VC investment in Africa. The West African country is already on track to surpass last year’s $167 million in equity funding raised. An analysis of the Big Deal’s database shows that Ghana had raised $133 million in equity funding by the end of July, after startups including mPharma, Dash and Fido received sizable capital. Fintechs in Africa continue to overshadow all other startups in funding gained  Launch Africa Ventures managing partner Zachariah George told TechCrunch that a Pan-African approach has allowed access to lucrative deals. “We have gotten deals at a discount because there are still not many investors looking into these regions, yet the need for early investments is very high,” he said, adding that when considering the countries to invest in, the firm looks at internet penetration, market readiness and the literacy levels of the population. “We are keen on countries with high smartphone and affordable internet penetration, and a population that is increasingly tech savvy. A dense population that is also economically active and liberal governance matters a lot, too.” Launch Africa is currently the most active VC in Africa, having funded more than 100 startups across 20 countries, a third of which are outside the four main markets. The seed and early-stage VC has invested in fintechs like Sudan’s Bloom and insurtechs AlphaDirect (Botswana) and Digitech Group (Côte d’Ivoire). Overall, nearly a third of the deals signed outside the Big Four in Africa last year focused on the Francophone region, which attracted over half a billion dollars in VC funding — 695% year-on year growth, according to Partech. The funding reached 13 countries in the region last year, including Senegal, which has recently drawn extensive interest from VCs looking for emerging opportunities. Last year, Senegal ousted Ghana as the fifth most preferred VC investment destination, propelled by Wave’s mega-round, which also pushed the mobile money provider to unicorn status and drew a spotlight on the West African country. Wave is the first unicorn in the Francophone region. “Francophone Africa is increasingly becoming attractive for investors due to the massive market opportunity, limited competition and similar laws/regulations, which makes it easier for companies to scale faster,” Boreto said. “Wave Money [is an] eye-opener to what opportunities lay in that region.” Four other countries within the Francophone region — Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon and Togo — have drawn multiple deals and funding to startups in fintech, insurtech, web3, and agtech, among others. Across the board, fintech continues to be the most sought-after sector because the underdeveloped financial services ecosystem in most countries presents an attractive opportunity for uptake — and therefore the potential for great returns through future exits. New report examines Africa’s growth in the digital economy and VC investment landscape  Startups in Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia have also experienced a spike in investor interest, having closed 31 deals last year worth $109 million, up 443% year on year, according to Partech. Of the three northern Africa countries, Tunisia is showing the greatest growth potential this year, having hit over $115 million in startup funding so far following a mega-round by AI startup InstaDeep — which, like Senegal’s Wave, is expected to continue to spark investor curiosity in that country. In Southern Africa, Zambia is emerging as a tech powerhouse due to concerted efforts by tech leaders who are pushing the government to create business-friendly regulations that will attract investor confidence and capital. Among the supporters of this bid is Perseus Mlambo, co-founder of Union54, a fintech that allows companies to issue debit cards that raised $12 million in April. Ethereum co-creator Vitalik Buterin is also reportedly supporting Zambia’s plan to be a tech hub. Startups in neighboring Zimbabwe seem to be increasingly attracting investors, too. FlexID, a blockchain-based identity system, recently secured funding from Algorand, a blockchain protocol. John Kamara, co-founder of venture studio Adanian Labs, which has five hubs in the continent — including in Zambia — told TechCrunch that he expects investor interest to continue growing in the southern region of the continent. “I still think to an extent that parts of Southern Africa are frontier markets. … Zambia definitely stands out at the moment in terms of opportunity. Once you can navigate the infrastructural problems in the country, the talent, the resource, the opportunity is without a doubt there,” he said. “Participating in developing secondary countries allows us to explore how we can trade amongst ourselves. We are also able to take the borderless Africa approach, which will allow us to build really massive startups.” Venture studio Adanian Labs fuels startup growth in Africa ","Africa’s tech startup scene has grown significantly over the last decade, with various reports showing a sizable increase in the number of deals, ticket sizes and funding.

"Yassir pulls in $150M for its super app, led by Bond",https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/07/yassir-pulls-in-150m-for-its-super-app-led-by-mary-meekers-bond/,"Yassir, an African super app platform that offers on-demand services such as ride-hailing, food and grocery delivery, and payments, has raised $150 million in Series B funding, five times what it raised in its previous priced round last November.  The investment was led by Bond, the growth-stage firm that Mary Meeker spun out of Kleiner Perkins in 2018. Other investors in the growth round include DN Capital, Dorsal Capital, Quiet Capital, Stanford Alumni Ventures and Y Combinator via its Continuity Fund, among other strategic investors.  The African startup, first launched in Algeria, has now raised $193.25 million since its inception in 2017. While its valuation remains undisclosed, Yassir considers itself the most valuable startup in North Africa and one of the highest-valued startups in Africa and the Middle East, where it plans to expand in the coming months. When CEO Noureddine Tayebi started Yassir, the plan was to build a super app that included services people — in the French-speaking Maghreb region consisting of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia — had little or no access to on one platform. So far, its execution has been spot on. Not only is the company offering ride-hailing and food and grocery delivery services (via Yassir Express) in 45 cities across six countries, but this report also says that three out of five on-demand activities in Algeria, its first market, are made via the platform.  This calculated growth has moved Yassir closer to its overarching plan to provide banking and payments. According to Tayebi, providing on-demand services in food and transportation was the entry point that allowed Yassir to gain users’ trust — which he argues is one reason most Africans are unbanked — for this endeavor. For perspective: Over 65% of Morocco’s (one of Yassir’s main markets) population does not own a bank account, and according to a 2018 McKinsey report on growth and innovation in African retail banking, 57% of the continent’s population lack any form of a bank account. Yet, the report also highlights that 40% of Africa’s banked population prefers digital channels for transactions. Therefore, Yassir’s thesis is that providing consumers with a mobile banking solution as part of a broader suite of services will meet an essential need in the African market, where 50% of the population can access the internet.  “Our business model from day one was a super app model and getting into payments. When we first started, the observation was that most people were unbanked, and the number one reason is that people don’t trust the banking systems here for various reasons,” the chief executive told TechCrunch in an interview. “We thought we could provide on-demand services that solve immediate needs around where people spent their money. We knew if we executed well, we could have a large user base that subconsciously trusts us, which we felt was pertinent to offering payment services.” Yassir, an all-in-one ecosystem app, provides its customers with a single-point solution for managing their day-to-day activities, from traveling to work to ordering groceries and meals. Its financial services serve this multisided marketplace ecosystem, which includes 8 million users (over 2.5x from last year) and 100,000 partners consisting of drivers, couriers, merchants, suppliers and wholesalers. Yassir is leveraging this network — which also includes a B2B e-commerce retail part that connects fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) suppliers with merchants — for its payments play assembled on top wallet provision and deployment of drivers and couriers as money agents. Image Credits: Yassir Image Credits: Yassir What’s next for the YC-backed platform with components from Uber, DoorDash, Udaan and PayPal? “First, we want to create a local tech startup success model which will be emulated by others and more so Yassir team members,” Tayebi answered. “Second, we want to empower the local talent and, more importantly, the technical talent which often leaves the region, mainly to Europe, to pursue further studies or find jobs,” added the chief executive, who, after earning a PhD at Stanford and spending 15 years in Silicon Valley working at various companies, returned to Algeria in 2016 to get involved in the country’s nascent tech scene.  As such, Tayebi, who founded Yassir with Mahdi Yettou, says the startup intends to invest heavily in its engineering and product teams by tripling their size, at the least. He also underscored how the funding will assist Yassir — which has offices in Algeria, Canada, France, Morocco and Tunisia — in consolidating its growth, rolling out new services in the existing markets, and expanding into new geographies across Africa and the Middle East directly or via acquisitions.  “Although we like to consider ourselves as leaders in the Maghreb region, we’re just scratching the surface, and there’s still a lot of room to grow,” expressed the Silicon Valley-based Algerian entrepreneur while noting that Yassir isn’t fazed by Uber and Bolt’s duopoly in the ride-hailing category across some of the markets it plans to expand into. His confidence stems from Yassir’s dominance in its main markets where the Uber-subsidiary Careem has struggled.  Algeria’s Yassir picks up $30M to build a super app in North Africa  Yassir is one of five Africa-focused startups to have closed a mega-round — that is, investment rounds greater than $100 million — this year. The self-described most valuable North African startup joins Flutterwave, Wasoko, Instadeep and Sun King on the shortlist, which as of last year included 10 startups. This reduced number is a stark example of how quickly markets change and reflects ongoing global macroeconomic challenges that have seen startups lay off employees, slash valuations or go bust. But while startups have generally faced a stricter fundraising environment this year, Tayebi claims it wasn’t the case with Yassir.  “In our first few years, we had a hard time raising money because of the region we operate in, despite us executing well,” he said. “That pushed us to be frugal and conscious of unit economics, profitability and burn rate. And with the market shifts, we could still show that we had grown significantly with outstanding unit economics. So fundraising was easier because we grew so much that VC firms could not ignore us anymore.” Daegwon Chae, a general partner at Bond, one of these VC firms, said his firm’s lead investment in Yassir stands on the sentiment that technology will “rearchitect” consumers’ relationships with transportation, food, and financial services globally. “This investment is an extension of that belief in an underserved but dynamic, rapidly growing region. Emerging out of North Africa, the app has already become indispensable to users for critical aspects of their lives,” he added. Mary Meeker’s Bond has closed its second fund with $2 billion ","Yassir, an African super app platform that offers on-demand services such as ride-hailing, food and grocery delivery, and payments, has raised $150 million in Series B funding.

Why Africa had no unicorns last year despite record fundraising haul,https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/12/why-africa-had-no-unicorns-last-year-despite-record-fundraising-haul/,"The African tech scene was met with fanfare in 2021: Venture capital investments in the region totaled between $4 billion and $5 billion and produced five unicorns. In my piece detailing this progress, I predicted there would be more unicorns in 2022. Those predictions proved to be way off the mark by year’s end. Data from market insights trackers Briter Bridges and The Big Deal reveal that funding raised by African startups exceeded $5 billion (including undisclosed deals) in 2022 — a slight percentage increase from the figures reported in 2021 despite a global pullback in VC funding. And yet, no unicorns popped up throughout the year, compared to five in 2021. That fact may appear insignificant because, at the end of the day, private valuations don’t pass an actual test till startups go public. However, producing no unicorns despite raising more venture capital suggests it’s perhaps too early to assume African markets are mature enough to consistently pop out private billion-dollar companies like their Global South counterparts: India, Southeast Asia and Latin America. That said, 2022 was peculiar. The global economic downturn and venture capital crunch ensured that every region produced fewer billion-dollar companies than the previous year. Globally, 216 unicorns were minted in 2022, per Tracxn, compared to 541 in the previous year. In India, 22 companies became unicorns last year, compared to 46 in 2021. While 18 companies in Latin America got their horns in 2021, that figure fell to just eight last year. Unlike Africa, these regions raised way less venture capital in 2022 than in 2021, so it makes sense that their unicorn numbers dropped. For example, in India, the number of unicorns dropped by more than half as VC activity dropped by 33%. Latin America and Southeast Asia also witnessed a double-digit decline in VC funding last year compared to 2021, though the drop in unicorns indicates more damage. So what happened in Africa in 2022 that made it so … weird?  Africa’s lack of unicorns in 2022 could be attributed to less involvement from growth investors such as Tiger Global, Sequoia Capital and SoftBank from the continent’s markets. After a long hiatus, Tiger Global backed five African startups in 2021, including the unicorn Series C round of African payments company Flutterwave. Except for a follow-on in Flutterwave’s Series D, Tiger Global — which made another five investments in Africa in 2022 — didn’t back any startup past the Series B stage (Wasoko’s $625 million round) last year. While these deals fit into Tiger Global’s strategy of investing in Series A and B deals and buying larger stakes for less, they were all announced before the end of Q2. That was when the global investor announced it was set for its worst year ever in accumulated losses and sold several of its public stakes. As such, the crossover fund’s concerning performance caused it to retreat from conducting more deals. Tiger Global is earning its stripes in Africa  It’s not farfetched to assume that at least one unicorn would’ve popped up if the hedge fund carried on with business as usual. The same can be said with SoftBank and Sequoia, which made two deals between them last year in Africa: Afriex and Apollo Agriculture. In 2021, these growth investors were notable for funding mega-rounds at insanely high valuations in companies across emerging markets (in Africa, for example, they backed four out of the five unicorns minted). The bottom line is that in a year where VCs put money to work in record amounts, thus generating a record number of unicorn companies, Africa, just like other regions, profited from it. However, in a more stringent market, fewer mega-rounds mean fewer unicorns, and that’s what we got in 2022. African tech had 11 mega-rounds in 2021 and produced five unicorns; in 2022, it had seven — Sun King, Flutterwave (a sequel to its unicorn round), Wasoko, Interswitch, InstaDeep, MFS Africa and Yassir — and failed to birth a single billion-dollar startup. Three African unicorns minted in 2021 — Chipper Cash, Wave and OPay — got their billion-dollar status two to three years into their startup journeys, outlier experiences even by global standards. According to various reports, a startup takes five to 10 years to reach a $1 billion valuation. We should remember that the unicorn rounds mentioned above were fueled by money and tech from Silicon Valley and China in venture capital’s best-ever year and that it takes much longer to hit $1 billion in valuation for an African startup — Interswitch had to wait 17 years. To back this point: Of the 30 companies that have crossed the Series C stage (where unicorns typically start to emerge) in the last two decades, per data from Briter Bridges, more than half launched operations 10 years ago and have yet to earn their horn. This also showcases that Africa didn’t have a large enough pool of growth-stage startups that late-stage private investors like Tiger Global, Sequoia and SoftBank believed could generate massive returns. However, this pipeline may improve due to the emergence of younger upstarts that raised multiple rounds in the last few years at valuations slightly short of $1 billion. Wasoko, Kuda, TymeBank, TeamApt, Yoco, JUMO and Yassir are some examples of these so-called soonicorns. MFS Africa, MNT-Halan and Cellulant are older companies that could be unicorns in the next two to five years. Thanks to a 13-year bull run and abundant capital in the global venture ecosystem, private valuation multiples skyrocketed to as much as 30x in 2021 or 300x in some cases. For companies that raised while money was cheap, now that the fun is over, only a handful can justify their billion-dollar valuation marks. Unicorns face 5-1 odds as they wait for public markets to warm  As The Exchange noted in this piece: “Unicorns, many of which raised capital during the 2021 boom at valuations that no longer square with market norms, are holding off raising capital until conditions improve. The bet they are taking is that they can survive off their last cash haul long enough to make it through a valuation trough and raise on the other side, when prices improve.” Those who can’t hold off raising capital will do so at flat or down rounds, which have become the norm of late. As startups scramble to justify their valuations, investors are looking to public markets to determine what new valuations to settle on. Most startups would need roughly $150 million to $200 million of annual revenue for a unicorn valuation to be justifiable based on today’s public market multiples. Not many African startups can boast such numbers, which may make it insanely hard for the continent to mint new unicorns in this latest fundraising environment. As a matter of fact, the unicorns produced in 2021, like their counterparts globally, could see their valuations revised — internally or in a newly priced round — this year, just as FTX, before its bankruptcy, did with cross-border payments Chipper Cash. A record fundraising haul for two consecutive years is no fluke. But most deals happen at the early stage due to local VC firms pulling their weight and global investors attracted to new opportunities on the continent (of the more than 900 deals executed on the continent last year, over 40% of them fell in Series A rounds and below, per data from funding trackers). Thus, the shortage of deals around growth-stage investments means not enough investors are helping startups move up from the Series C stage, which is where billion-dollar companies are formed. Before African tech can be on par with other emerging markets in the formation of unicorns, late-stage investment deals need to increase, and this is something we’ll be tracking.","African tech had 11 mega-rounds in 2021 and produced five unicorns. In 2022, it had seven — Sun King, Flutterwave (a sequel to its unicorn round), Wasoko, Interswitch, InstaDeep, MFS Africa and Yir — and three failed to birth a single billion-dollar startup."
Last year was a tough period for African growth-stage startups and 2024 presents a mixed bag,https://techcrunch.com/2024/01/05/african-startup-ecosystem-outlook/,"Last year presented a tough period for African tech startups. Venture capital was hard to bag (as predicted earlier), bridge and down rounds became the norm, and news of fire sales, layoffs and startup closures reverberated across the continent. With the overall amount of VC funding raised in Africa dipping significantly across the year, according to initial reports, after steady growth over the last decade (and the windfall of the previous two years), startups and scale-ups in the continent have suffered far-reaching consequences. Unshockingly, while capital became elusive from all fronts, growth-stage companies in Africa bore the brunt of the market correction, hot on the heels of a season of bountiful funding and high valuations. Companies such as South Africa’s WhereIsMyTransport, a mobility startup, and Sendy, a Kenyan logistics company, shut down after failing to raise fresh funding. WhereIsMyTransport had raised $27 million from VC heavyweights, including Google, SBI Investment and Toyota Tsusho Corporation. Sendy also counted Toyota in its investor lineup, which also had Atlantica Ventures leading its $20 million Series B round in 2020. Tens of other growth-stage companies found it hard to survive and were forced to scale back operations as investors changed tune from “growth at all costs” to profitability. Scaling down is unavoidable sometimes, according to seasoned entrepreneur Ken Njoroge, co-founder of Cellulant, a payments company. “If the entrepreneurs hunker down and fix the unit economics and thrive, they can come out of the gates really battle-hardened and have the ability to operate lean. This can be a source of lasting competitive advantage,” said Njoroge. Chipper Cash, a fintech, conducted more rounds of layoffs as the cash crunch continued with the tough times worsened by the collapse of FTX and Silicon Valley Bank, the institutions that led its $250 million Series C and extension round in 2021 and which would have presumably been of aid in tough times. Cellulant also opted for a leaner, “product-led growth strategy,” dropping 20% of their employees. Ghanaian health tech mPharma laid off 150 people, too. The carnage extended to B2B e-commerce businesses, including Copia Global, which exited the Uganda market and laid off 700 people. Twiga shattered its sales and in-house delivery divisions, releasing hundreds of employees, while MarketForce exited all but one of its markets. Nigeria’s Alerzo downsized too. Wasoko and MaxAB are exploring consolidation in a bid for survival. The aforementioned companies, and many others, have historically sourced their funding outside the continent, with just a handful of Africa-focused funds able to write big checks. Data shows that most venture funding in Africa comes from foreign VCs (about 77%), which is untenable for the ecosystem’s growth. This has been proven true as the well-backed foreign VCs that trooped the continent over the last few years rescinded. These VCs, with no obligation to invest in Africa, are holding off making new investments to refocus on their primary markets. They have become more selective on who they back, making huge checks hard to come by for African enterprises. Njoroge said founders need to be aware of the funding gap: “We don’t have an abundance of capital [and] creating customer value and driving revenue is the most reliable source of funding a business. Businesses need to get very good at that to survive all seasons, including the funding winter that is there today and will be for a while.” Andreata Muforo, TLcom partner, says African companies can raise from private equity funds that invest in late-stage VC companies, take up debt or raise bridge financing from their investors. However, she underlines that a bridge round would only be possible in these challenging times if the companies have African investors committed to the ecosystem in all seasons. “Bridge rounds can also help bring in investors who are interested in investing but cannot lead a round. So, at attractive and reasonable terms, founders can attract them to participate earlier,” she said. Meanwhile, as founders explore funding options to remain afloat, Mareme Dieng, the Africa lead at 500 Global, highlighted the importance of investor support in ensuring portfolio companies continue to focus on their customers and the path to profitability. “We should be planning and executing with the assumption that market conditions will not improve. I expect that we will be pushing our portfolio companies in Africa to assume that market conditions are to remain challenging in 2024 and that they should continue the initial course set in 2023 to focus on profitability and value to customers,” said Dieng. Muforo added that companies must also have an efficient working capital strategy, including ensuring higher margin products or services, renegotiating credit terms with debtors and creditors, and optimizing inventory management. However, it’s not all gloom for the ecosystem, as the funding downtime acts as a litmus test for what works or doesn’t work in Africa. If anything, the tough times have, for instance, revealed that B2B e-commerce companies have mostly had unfavorable unit economics and high burn rates. This has called for new approaches that guarantee higher margins to make money, like optimizing logistics or selling high-profit margin goods. Huge funding rounds, it has been revealed, cannot be used to cover flawed business models. Njoroge said founders need to study their markets first to know what works, adding that founders need not be too quick to raise funding and should go for very little of it to get product-market-fit (PMF) and go-to-market fit (GMF). This is to establish profitability first and only raise to grow. He argues that building a large company in Africa takes time, often outside the time span of most foreign funds. “This is a much gentler, measured and longer process than the time frames studied in more mature ecosystems,” said Njoroge. Building in Africa also means that to create a large market, operating in multiple countries is inevitable, demanding adaptable business models. “This typically means that the journey of finding product-market fit and go-to-market fit takes longer than in the U.S. Customer trust takes longer to build. Talent depth and breadth take longer to build because it is a young ecosystem,” he said. African countries are also diverse and have unique challenges and opportunities. There are specific macroeconomic, operational, social and cultural factors to keep in mind when scaling up, according to Olugbenga Agboola (GB), Flutterwave co-founder and CEO. “Companies growing across Africa should always pay attention to the local aspects in their growth strategies,” said Agboola. The funding winter means businesses must re-think their strategies, stay lean and pay much focus on business fundamentals. Experts say this is the time to separate the grain from the chaff and the best time for established businesses to thrive. MaryAnne Ochola, the managing director of Endeavor Kenya, believes that the surviving companies now contend with less competition for customers and talent. She noted that it is also the best time to build resilience as a founder. “Building in a low resource environment forces founders to be scrappy in ways that when the markets turn, it will place them in good stead,” she said. Besides, the return of sobriety in the VC ecosystem will allow the building of a more sustainable ecosystem, according to Muforo. She anticipates that there will be fewer exits in 2024 owing to the scaled-down growth emanating from the funding crunch. On the other hand, Agboola expects that “the IPO window could open a little bit.” He foresees a rebound in funding driven by unallocated funding, but he adds that it may not reach the levels of 2020/21. Njoroge, too, anticipates more deployment of African capital, while Ochola expects the market for later rounds to remain sluggish as deal activity for early-stage funding grows. The success of growth-stage companies is often tied to exits through acquisition or going public. Regardless of whether there’s a potential rebound in venture capital or not, African growth-stage companies risk becoming “zombies,” meaning they have substantial revenues but struggle to attract M&A interest or surpass their current valuations. Africa faces challenges in this respect, having the fewest exit options and buyers for tech startups compared to other global VC markets. Despite over a decade of consistent venture capital inflow, the African tech ecosystem has seen only a handful of notable acquisitions, such as Instadeep to BioNTech, Paystack to Stripe, DPO Group to Network International and Fundamo to Visa. In a scenario where venture capital remains scarce and global companies aren’t stepping to the rescue, growth- and late-stage companies in Africa may consider other strategic moves such as buying out their investors, exploring mergers, diversifying funding sources through options like venture debt and private equity, or opting for an IPO. Flutterwave, Africa’s largest startup by valuation, has been in the headlines for its IPO plans over the past year, addressing several allegations along the way. Flutterwave’s journey is closely observed, just like its counterpart Interswitch years ago, and as the company actively improves its corporate governance practices, there is heightened anticipation for it to demonstrate that foreign investors’ investment in the continent is well-placed. So far, the Tiger- and Avenir-backed fintech has displayed intent. It’s trying to make its business more attractive in the U.S. by acquiring 13 money transmission licenses to power its Send app while adding executives from global firms such as Binance, PayPal, Western Union and CashApp to its team. The significance of the investors brought on board by growth-stage companies cannot be overstated, as they can play a pivotal role in either propelling a company to, for instance, go public or bring it down to earth. A notable example is the case of 54gene, an African genomics startup that closed its doors last September. Several factors contributed to 54gene’s demise, ranging from executives commanding very high salaries to the capital-intensive nature of the business. However, one that went under the radar was the terms of the bridge deal 54gene struck after raising $45 million. The round saw its valuation drop two-thirds at a 3-4x liquidation preference. Such terms, once rare during the venture capital boom, have become commonplace in the current fundraising environment. However, cap tables with below-normal ownership for active founders impact future raises and may necessitate restructuring to attract additional capital. In instances like these, Muforo aptly captures the dynamics at play: When VCs are aggressive with terms it is most likely that things have gone sideways in the business strategy implementation, use of capital, or the previous terms no longer match the business’ current and expected growth trajectory. If a company is well-run, is operating in an attractive space and has significant upside, a business should have more funding options and unlikely that one investor would prey. Clearly what was happening in 2021/22 was not only sided in favor of the founders but also was not sustainable as we have come to see. We saw high valuations that were not substantiated by company performance, and there was neglect for proper governance structures. That’s not how you build a sustainable ecosystem and many of such companies are unravelling as seen in down rounds, and incidences of bad governance. According to Muforo, growth-stage founders should conduct thorough research on potential investors before bringing them on board. This involves understanding all investment terms, seeking legal advice, and discussing an ESOP structure tied to milestones. In situations with challenging terms, Muforo advises growth-stage founders to raise the appropriate amount of capital for their next milestones, avoid excess and implement cost-cutting measures to extend their runway. However, the responsibility goes both ways. When investors are excessively founder-friendly, neglect due diligence or fail to establish internal corporate governance controls, the African tech ecosystem may experience implosions akin to Dash. The Ghanaian fintech raised over $50 million but ultimately shut down due to allegations of the founder misreporting financials and mismanaging funds. Both events underscore the importance of a balanced and transparent relationship between African founders and investors for the health and sustainability of the tech ecosystem. In the wake of Dash’s closure due to fraud, 5 investors talk due diligence in Africa ","Last year presented a tough period for African tech startups. Venture capital was hard to bag (as predicted earlier), bridge and down rounds became the norm. Growth-stage companies in Africa bore the brunt of the market correction."

Since then, his cryptologic research has led to developments like digital cash and anonymous communication networks. Today, he launched xxmessenger, which the company describes as the first “quantum-resistant” messaging app. When we asked him what has changed in the past few years, Chaum said, “Seems to me that Bitcoin and the like have created something that could no longer be ignored.
